<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>All classic scholars are familiar with the Legends of Virgil
in the Middle Ages, in which the poet appears as a magician, the
last and best collection of these being that which forms the
second volume of &ldquo;Virgilio nel Medio Aevo,&rdquo; by
Senator Professor Domenico Comparetti.&nbsp; But having
conjectured that Dante must have made Virgil familiar to the
people, and that many legends or traditions still remained to be
collected, I applied myself to this task, with the result that in
due time I gathered, or had gathered for me, about one hundred
tales, of which only three or four had a plot in common with the
old Neapolitan Virgilian stories, and even these contained
original and very curious additional lore.&nbsp; One half of
these traditions will be found in this work.</p>
<p>As these were nearly all taken down by a fortune-teller or
witch among her kind&mdash;she being singularly well qualified by
years of practice in finding and recording such recondite
lore&mdash;they very naturally contain much more that is occult,
strange and heathen, than can be found in the other tales.&nbsp;
Thus, wherever there is opportunity, magical ceremonies are
described and incantations given; in fact, the story is often
only a mere frame, as it were, in which the picture or true
subject is a lesson in sorcery.</p>
<p>But what is most remarkable and interesting in these
traditions, as I have often had occasion to remark, is the <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>fact that
they embody a vast amount of old Etrusco-Roman minor mythology of
the kind chronicled by Ovid, and incidentally touched on or
quoted here and there by gossiping Latin writers, yet of which no
record was ever made.&nbsp; I am sincerely persuaded that there
was an immense repertory of this fairy, goblin, or witch religion
believed in by the Roman people which was never written down, but
of which a great deal was preserved by sorcerers, who are mostly
at the same time story-tellers among themselves, and of this much
may be found in this work.&nbsp; And I think no critic, however
inclined to doubt he may be, will deny that there is in the old
mythologists collateral evidence to prove what I have
asserted.</p>
<p>It may be observed that in these Northern legends, Virgil is
in most cases spoken of as a poet as well as magician, but that
he is before all, benevolent and genial, a great sage invariably
doing good, while always inspired with humour.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson
Ellis has shrewdly observed that, in reading the Neapolitan tales
of Virgil, &ldquo;we are painfully struck with the absence, for
the most part, of any imaginative element in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
would, however, suggest, that in these which I have gathered with
no small pains&mdash;having devoted a great part of my time for
several years to the task&mdash;there is no want of imagination,
romance or humour.</p>
<p>Such are, in brief, the contents of this book.&nbsp; Sincerely
trusting that the press and public may treat it as kindly as they
did the &ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Legends of Florence,&rdquo; I await the verdict, which will
probably determine whether I shall publish other Italian
traditions, of which I have still a very large collection.</p>

xi</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est bien raison que je vous compte
des histoires de Virgille de Romme lequel en son temps, fis moult
de merveilles.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Les Faictz Merveilleux de
Virgille</i>.&nbsp; <i>XVIth Century</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader is probably aware that during the Middle Ages,
Virgil, who had always retained great fame as a poet, and who was
kindly regarded as almost a Christian from a conjectured pious
prophecy in his works, underwent the process of being made
romantic and converted into a magician.&nbsp; How it all came to
pass is admirably set forth by Professor Domenico Comparetti in
his truly great work on &ldquo;Virgil in the Middle Ages.&rdquo;
<a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
<p>During the twelfth century, and for some time after, many
learned pilgrims or tourists from different parts of Europe,
while in Italy, hearing from the people these tales, which had a
great charm in an age when the marvellous formed the basis of
nearly all literature, gave them to the world in different
forms.&nbsp; And as the fame of Virgil as a poet was almost the
first fact learned by those who studied Latin, legends relating
to him spread far and wide.&nbsp; The Mantuan bard had been
well-nigh deified by the Romans.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silius Italicus
used to celebrate his birthday every year, visiting his tomb as
if it were a temple, and as a temple the Neapolitan Statius used
to regard it.&rdquo; <a name="citation0b"></a><a
href="#footnote0b" class="citation">[0b]</a>&nbsp; And this
reverence was preserved by the Christians, who even added to it a
peculiar lore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These tales,&rdquo; says Comparetti, &ldquo;originated
in Naples, and thence spread into European literature, in the
first <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>instance, however, outside Italy.&nbsp; Their origin in
Italy was entirely the work of the lower classes, and had nothing
to do with poetry or literature; it was a popular superstition
founded on local records connected with Virgil&rsquo;s long
residence in Naples, and the celebrity of his tomb in that
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This latter is a shrewd observation, for as the tomb is close
by the mysterious grotto of Posilippo, which was always supposed
to have been made by magic, it was natural that Virgil, who was
famed for wisdom, should have been supposed to have wrought the
miracle, and it may well be that this was really the very first,
or the beginning of all the legends in question.&nbsp; These were
&ldquo;connected with certain localities, statues and monuments
in the neighbourhood of Naples itself, to which Virgil was
supposed to have given a magic power.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp;
Foreigners who visited Naples thus learned these legends, and
they passed &ldquo;even into Latin works of a learned
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it resulted that from the twelfth century
onward the fame of Virgil as a magician spread all over
Europe.&nbsp; Among those who thus made of him a wonder-worker
were Conrad von Querfurt, Gervase of Tilbury, Alexander Neckham,
and John of Salisbury.</p>
<p>That these marvellous tales were localized in Naples, and
there first applied to Virgil, may be freely admitted, but that
they really originated or were first invented there will be
claimed by no one familiar with older or Oriental legends.&nbsp;
This has not escaped Senator Comparetti, who observes that
wonders attributed long before to Apollonius of Tyana and others
&ldquo;are practically identical with those attributed in Naples
to Virgil.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of setting up the image of a fly
to drive away flies, as Virgil did in one legend, is Babylonian,
for in Lenormand&rsquo;s Chald&aelig;an Magic we are told that
demons are driven away by their own images, and Baalzebub, as
chief of flies, was probably the first honoured in this
respect.</p>
<p>That is to say, that little by little and year by year the
tales which had been told of other men in earlier
times&mdash;magicians, sorcerers, and wizards wild&mdash;were
remade and attributed to Virgil.&nbsp; The very first specimen of
an ancient Italian <i>novella</i>, given by Roscoe, is a
Virgilian legend, though the translator makes no mention of
it.&nbsp; So in the &ldquo;Pentamerone&rdquo; of Giambattista
Basile of Naples we find that <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>most of the tales come from the
East, and had been of old attributed to Buddha, or some other
great man.</p>
<p>The Neapolitan stories of Virgil were spread far and wide,
into almost every language in Europe; but they had their day, and
now rank with black-letter literature, being republished still,
but for scholars only.&nbsp; I had read most of them in my youth,
and when the work of Senator Comparetti appeared, I was struck by
the singular fact that there is next to nothing in all the vast
amount of Virgilian&aelig; which he quotes, which appears to have
been gathered of late among the people at large.&nbsp; A great
number of classic and medi&aelig;val names and characters are
very familiar to the most ignorant Italians.&nbsp; How came it to
pass that nothing is known of Virgil, who appears in the
&ldquo;Divina Commedia&rdquo; as the guide, philosopher, and
friend of Dante, whose works are read by all.</p>
<p>Inspired with this idea, I went to work and soon found that,
as I had conjectured, there were still extant among the people a
really great number of what may be called post-Virgilian legends,
which possibly owe their existence, or popularity, to the Virgil
of Dante.&nbsp; A very few of them are like certain of the old
Neapolitan tales, but even these have been greatly changed in
details.&nbsp; As might have been expected of Northern Italian
narratives, they partake more of the nature of the <i>novella</i>
or short romance, than of the nursery-tale or the mere anecdote,
as given by the earlier writers.&nbsp; That is to say, there was,
after Dante, among the people a kind of renaissance in the fame
of Virgil as a magician.&nbsp; It is by a curious coincidence
that, as Senator Comparetti admits, all the earlier legends of
the bard were gathered and published by foreigners; so have these
of later time been collected by one not to the country born.</p>
<p>One good reason why I obtained so many of these tales so
readily is that they were gathered, like my &ldquo;Florentine
Legends&rdquo; and &ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains,&rdquo; chiefly
among witches or fortune-tellers, who, above all other people,
preserve with very natural interest all that smacks of
sorcery.&nbsp; It is the case in every country&mdash;among Red
Indians, Hindus or Italians&mdash;that wherever there are
families in which witchcraft is handed down from generation to
generation there will be traditional tales in abundance, and
those not of the common fairy-tale kind, but of a mysterious,
marvellous nature.&nbsp; Now, that the narratives in this book
contain&mdash;<a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>quite apart from any connection with Virgil&mdash;in
almost every instance some curious traces of very ancient
tradition, is perhaps to be admitted by all.&nbsp; Such is the
description of Agamene, the Spirit of the Diamond, which is one
of the oldest of Gr&aelig;co-Roman myths, and P&aelig;onia, who
kills or revives human beings by means of flowers, wherein she is
the very counterpart of Minerva-P&aelig;onia, who taught
Esculapius, as mythology expressly states, &ldquo;the power of
flowers and herbs,&rdquo; even as the statue P&aelig;onia teaches
Virgil.&nbsp; These are only two out of scores of instances, and
they are to me, as they will be to every scholar, by far the most
valuable part of my book.</p>
<p>These incidents, which I in many cases did not know, until
after subsequent search in mythologies, were ancient, certainly
could not have been invented by the very ignorant old women from
whom they were gathered.&nbsp; And this brings me to the
important consideration as to whether these stories are really
<i>authentic</i>.&nbsp; A learned Italian professor very lately
asked me how I could be sure that the common people did not palm
off on me their own inventions as legends of Virgil.&nbsp; To
which I replied that I would not be responsible for the antiquity
or origin of a single tale.&nbsp; For, in the first place, any
story of any sorcerer is often attributed to Virgil, so that in
two or three instances which I have specially noted &ldquo;a
Virgil&rdquo; means any magician.&nbsp; And very often I have
myself told some story as a hint or suggestion, in order to give
some idea as to what I wanted, or to revive the memory.&nbsp; But
in all cases they have come back to me so changed, and with such
strange fragments of classic lore of the most recondite kind
added, that I had no scruple in giving them just for what they
were worth, leaving it for critics to sift out the ancient from
the modern, even as the eagles described by Sinbad the Sailor,
brought back the legs of mutton with diamonds sticking to
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not,&rdquo; I said to the professor
of classical lore, &ldquo;reject newly-mined gold because it is
encumbered with dross; and that there may be much dross in all
which I have gathered I am sure; but there is gold in it
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nursery peasant tales collected by Grimm and Crane, and
many more, represent surface-diggings.&nbsp; Those who were first
in the field had an easy time in gathering what thousands
knew.&nbsp; But these finds are becoming exhausted, and the
collector of the future must mine out of the rock, <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>and seek for
deeper traditions which have been sedulously concealed or kept
secret.&nbsp; There are still many peasants who know this lore,
though their number is very rapidly diminishing, and they are, as
a rule, without exception, extremely averse to communicating it
to anyone whom they know or think is not what I may call a
fellow-heathen, or in true sympathy with them.&nbsp; I may give
in illustration of this an incident which occurred recently as I
write: Miss Roma Lister, who had an old Italian witch-nurse,
still living in Rome (and who has contributed several of these
tales of Virgil), who taught her something of the art
&ldquo;which none may name,&rdquo; while walking with a priest
near Calmaldoli, met with a man whom she knew had the reputation
of being a <i>stregone</i>, or wizard.&nbsp; She asked him,
<i>sotto voce</i>, if he knew the name of <i>Tinia</i>, one of
the Etruscan gods, still remembered by a few, and who is
described in the &ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
hastily replied in a whisper: &ldquo;Yes, yes; and I know the
incantation to him also&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let the priest hear
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a subsequent meeting they interchanged
confidences freely.&nbsp; Maddalena, whom I have chiefly employed
to make collections among witches and others, has often told me
how unwilling those who knew any witch-lore are to confess it,
especially to ladies or gentlemen.&nbsp; One must literally
conjure it out of them.</p>
<p>These tales of Virgil were collected in Florence, Volterra,
Rocca-Casciano, Arezzo, Siena, and several places near it, and
Rome.&nbsp; I have several not to be published, because they are
so trifling, or so utterly confused and badly written, or
&ldquo;shocking,&rdquo; that I could make nothing of them.&nbsp;
In all, however, which I have collected, with one
exception&mdash;which is manifestly a mere common fairy-tale
arbitrarily attributed to the subject as a
<i>magus</i>&mdash;Virgil appears as a great and very benevolent
man.&nbsp; He aids the poor and suffering, has great sympathy for
the weak and lowly, and is ever ready to reprove arrogance and
defeat the plans of evil sorcerers.&nbsp; But while great and
wise and dignified, he is very fond of a joke.&nbsp; Sometimes he
boldly punishes and reproves the Emperor of Rome&mdash;anon he
contrives some merry jest to amuse him.&nbsp; The general
agreement of so many stories drawn from different sources as to
this character is indeed remarkable.</p>
<p>As regards the general &ldquo;value&rdquo; of these Virgilian
tales, and a vast number of others which I have collected, all of
<a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>them
turning on magic or occult motives, it is well worth mentioning
that from one to three centuries ago a great number of tales very
much resembling them were published by Grosius, Pr&aelig;torius,
and others, as at a later date the &ldquo;Histoire des
Fant&ocirc;mes et des Demons,&rdquo; Paris, 1819, which work
unquestionably supplied Washington Irving with the story of the
Spectre Bridegroom, and another tale. <a name="citation0c"></a><a
href="#footnote0c" class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; In Italy, the
writers of <i>novella</i>, such as Boccaccio, Bandello, Cinthio,
and in fact nearly all of them, shook off and ridiculed all that
was associated with barbarous superstitions and incantations, and
yet in the &ldquo;Metamorphosi&rdquo; of Lorenzo Selva, Florence,
1591, and here and there in similar obscure works by writers not
so painfully afflicted by &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and style as the
leaders, there are witch and fairy-tales which might have come
from very old women, and would be certainly recognised by them as
familiar traditions.&nbsp; That these mysterious stories
contained an immense amount of valuable old Latin classic lore
and minor mythology, or that they were not altogether silly and
useless, does not seem to have entered the head of any one
Italian from Dante downward.&nbsp; Men like Straparola and Basile
made, it is true, collections of merry tales to amuse, but that
there was anything in them of solid traditional value never
occurred to them.&nbsp; I mention the few and far-between
witch-tales which are found in certain writers, because they are
marvellously like those which I have given.&nbsp; Some of these,
especially the later, are so elaborate or dramatic, or inspired
with what seems to be literary culture, that many who are only
familiar with simple fairy-tales might doubt whether the former
are really traditional folklore of the people, or even of
fortune-tellers.&nbsp; There is a curious fact, unnoted now,
which will be deeply dwelt on in a future age when folklore and
phases of culture will be far more broadly and deeply or genially
considered than they are at present.&nbsp; This is, that among
the masses in Italy there exists an extraordinary amount of a
certain kind of culture allied to gross ignorance, as is
amusingly illustrated in the commonest <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>language,
in which, even among the lowest peasants, one hears in every
sentence some transformed or melted Latin word of three or four
syllables, suggesting excess of culture&mdash;like unto which is
the universal use of the sonnet and <i>terzarime</i> among the
most ignorant.</p>
<p>If there are any readers who find it strange that in these
legends and traditions there are not only extraordinary but
apparently incredible remains of culture, fragments of mythology
and incantations, which pierce into the most mysterious depths of
arch&aelig;ology, they would do well to remember that the same
apparent paradox struck &ldquo;Vernon Lee,&rdquo; who treated it
very fully in her &ldquo;Euphorion,&rdquo; in the chapters on the
Outdoor Poetry of Italy.&nbsp; And among other things she thus
remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing can be too artificial or highflown
for the Italian peasantry; its tales are all of kings,
princesses, fairies, knights, winged horses, marvellous jewels .
. . its songs, almost without exception, about love, constancy,
moon, stars, flowers.&nbsp; Such things have not been degraded by
familiarity and parody, as in the town; they retain for the
country-folk the vague charm, like that of music, automatic and
independent of thorough comprehension, of belonging to a sphere
of the marvellous&mdash;hence they are repeated with almost
religious servility.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it must be remembered that with elaborate poetic forms and
fancies, which would be foreign or unintelligible, and certainly
unsympathetic, even to the fairly well-educated citizen of
England or America, there has been preserved to the very letter,
especially in Tuscany, a mass of literature which, while
resembling the romances of chivalry which Chaucer ridiculed, is
far ruder; it even surpasses the Norse prose sagas in
barbarism.&nbsp; The principal work of this kind is the
&ldquo;Reali di Francia,&rdquo; which is reprinted every year,
and which is at least a thousand years old.&nbsp; This work, and
several like it, are the greatest literary curiosities or
anomalies of the age.&nbsp; In them we are hurried from battle to
battle, from carnage to carnage, with rude interludes of love and
magic, as if even the Middle Age had never existed.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Nibelungen Lied&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heldenbuch&rdquo; are by
comparison to them refined and modern.</p>
<p>Can the reader imagine this as existing in combination with
the literary relics of the Renaissance and many strangely-refined
forms of speech?&nbsp; Just so among the youngest children in
Florence one sees gestures and glances <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>and
hears phrases which would seem to have been peculiar to grown-up
people in some bygone stage of society.&nbsp; It is really
necessary to bear all this in mind when reading the legends which
I have collected, for they present the contradictions of
barbarism and culture, of old Latin traditions and crass
ignorance, as I have never seen them even imagined by students of
culture.</p>
<p>And here I would remark, as allied to this subject, that
folklore is as yet far from being understood in all its
fulness.&nbsp; In France, for example, no scholar seems to have
got beyond the idea that it consists entirely of <i>traditions
populaires</i>, necessarily ancient.&nbsp; In England we have
advanced further, but we are still far from realizing that with
every day there springs up and grows among the masses that which
in days to come will be deeply interesting, as expressing the
spirit of the age.&nbsp; This accretive folklore is just as
valuable as any&mdash;or will be so&mdash;and it should be
gathered and studied, no matter what its origin may be.&nbsp; So
of this book of mine, I express the conviction that it contains
many tales which have, since the days of Dante, and many perhaps
very recently, been attached to the name of Virgil, yet do not
consider them less interesting than those collected in the
twelfth century by Gervais of Tilbury, Neckham, and others.&nbsp;
In fact, these here given actually contain far more ancient and
curious traditional matter, because they have not been abridged
or filed down by literary medi&aelig;val Latinists into mere
plots or anecdotes as contracted as the &ldquo;variants&rdquo; of
a modern folklorist.&nbsp; The older writers, and many of the
modern, regarded as ugly excrescence all that did not belong,
firstly, to scholarship or &ldquo;style&rdquo;; secondly, to the
fact or subject in hand.&nbsp; Thus, Lorenzo Selva gives a witch
story with six incantations, which are far more interesting than
all the washy poetry in his book, but is so ashamed of having
done so, that he states in a marginal note that he has only
preserved them to give an idea of &ldquo;the silliness of all
such iniquitous trash&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;iniquitous
trash&rdquo; in question being evidently of Etrusco-Roman origin,
to judge from form and similarity to other ancient spells.&nbsp;
In these later Virgilian tales there has been no scruple, either
as regards literary elegance or piety, to prevent the chronicler
from giving them just as they were told, the &ldquo;sinful and
silly&rdquo; incantations, when they occurred, being faithfully
retained, with all that can give an idea of <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>the true
spirit of the whole.&nbsp; The mean fear of appearing to be
vulgar, or credulous, or not literally &ldquo;genteel,&rdquo; has
caused thousands of such writers to suppress traditions worth far
more than all they ever penned.</p>
<p>I write this in the belief that all my critics will admit that
in these, as in my &ldquo;Florentine Legends&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains,&rdquo; I have really recovered and
recorded a great deal of valuable ancient tradition.&nbsp; Also
that what was preserved to us of ancient Etruscan or
Gr&aelig;co-Latin lore regarding the minor gods and sylvan
deities, goblins, etc., by classic writers is very trifling
indeed compared to the <i>immense</i> quantity which existed, and
that a great deal of it may still be found among the peasantry,
especially among wizards and witches, is unquestionable.&nbsp;
That I have secured some of this in my books is, I trust, true;
future critics will winnow it all out, and separate the wheat
from the chaff.</p>
<p>I have entitled this work &ldquo;The Unpublished Legends of
Virgil,&rdquo; which may be called a contradiction in terms,
since it is now given in type.&nbsp; But it is the only succinct
title of which I can think which expresses its real nature, and
separates it from the earlier collections of such tales, the
latest of which was issued by Mr. D. Nutt.</p>
<p>And, finally, I would remark with some hesitation in advancing
so strange an idea, that in all the legends which I have
gathered, I find persistence in a very rude and earlier faith,
which the Gr&aelig;co-Roman religion and Christianity itself,
instead of destroying, seem to have simply strengthened.&nbsp;
Indeed, there are remote villages in Italy in which Catholicism
in sober truth has come down to sorcery, or gradually conformed
to it, not only in form, but in spirit; from which I conclude
that, till science <i>pur et simple</i> shall be all-prevalent,
the oldest and lowest cults will exist among those whose minds
are adapted to them.&nbsp; And as Edward Clodd, the President of
the Folklore Society, has clearly shown, <a
name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a> there are thousands, even among the
highly-educated in Europe, who really belong to these old
believers.</p>
<p>There will come a day, and that not very far off, when the
last traces of these strange semi-spiritual-romantic or classic
traditions will have vanished from the <i>people</i>, and then
what has been recorded will be sought for and studied <a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>with keenest
interest, and conclusions drawn from it of which we have no
conception.&nbsp; To some of us they are even now only as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Departing sunbeams, loth to stop,<br />
Still smiling on the mountain-top.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the vast majority even of the somewhat educated world,
collecting such lore is like sending frigates to watch eclipses
and North Pole explorations, and the digging up old skulls in
Neanderthals&mdash;that is, a mere fond waste of money and study
to no really useful purpose.&nbsp; There is a law of evolution
which is so strictly and persistently carried out, that it would
seem as if the mocking devil, who, according to the Buddhists, is
the real head of the Universe, had it in his mind to jeer mankind
thereby&mdash;and it is that the work of man in the past shall
perish rapidly, and those who seek <i>vestigia rerum</i> shall
have as little material as possible, even as dreams flit.&nbsp;
So the strife goes ever on, chiefly aided by the ignorant, who
&ldquo;take no interest&rdquo; in the past; and so it will be for
some time to come.&nbsp; I have often observed that in Italy, as
in all countries, children and peasants take pleasure in
destroying old vases and the like, even when they could sell them
at a profit; and there is something of the same spirit among all
people regarding things which they do not understand.&nbsp;
Blessed are they who do something in their generation to teach to
the many the true value of all which conduces to culture or
science!&nbsp; Blessed be they who save up anything for the
future, &ldquo;and they shall be blest&rdquo; by wiser men to
come!&nbsp; The primeval savages who heaped up vast <i>koken
middens</i>, or thousands of tons of oyster-shells and bones, did
not know that they were writing history; but they did it.&nbsp;
Perhaps the wisest of us will be as savages to those who are to
come, as they in turn will be to later men.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
STORY OF ROMOLO AND REMOLO.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In quei buon tempi, ne i primi principii
del Mondo, dicon li Poeti che gli uomini e le Bestie facevano
tutti una medesima vita. . . .&nbsp; E che sia il vero ch&rsquo;
eglino s&rsquo; impastassino del feroce, como loro, e s&rsquo;
incorporassino, leggete di Romolo e Remulo i quali si pascevon di
latte di lupa.&nbsp; Ecco gi&agrave; che divennero in opera lupi
ingordissimi, e voraci.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>La Zucca del Doni
Fiorentino</i>, 1607.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was of old a King who had a beautiful wife, and also two
children, twins, who were exactly alike.&nbsp; This King was
named Romo and his wife Roma, and the children were called Romolo
and Remolo.</p>
<p>Now, it came to pass that the Queen and her twins, both as yet
sucklings (<i>ancora poppanti</i>), were besieged in a castle
when the King was far away.&nbsp; The enemy had sworn to kill the
whole royal family and to extirpate the kingly race.</p>
<p>Now, when the Queen was in sore distress, seeing death close
upon her, there came to her a wizard, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one way by which you can save your life
and that of your babes.&nbsp; I can change you all three into
<i>lupi manari</i>, or were-wolves, and thus in the form of
wolves you may escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen had the power to become a she-wolf or a human
being at her will, and it was the same with the children.&nbsp;
So they fled away, and lived in the woods for seven years; and
the boys grew up like young giants, as strong as six common
children.&nbsp; And the Queen became more beautiful than ever,
for she lived under a spell.</p>
<p>One day the King was hunting in the forest, when he <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>found himself
alone, and surrounded by such a flock of raging wolves that his
life was in great danger, when all at once there came a very
beautiful woman, who seemed to have great power over the beasts,
as if she were their queen, for they obeyed her and
retreated.&nbsp; Then the King recognised in her his lost
wife.&nbsp; So they returned with the twins to their castle, but
the King did not know that his wife and children were themselves
were-wolves.</p>
<p>One day the same enemy who had sought to kill the Queen seven
years before, of which the King knew nothing, came to the castle
pretending to be a friend, and was kindly treated.&nbsp; But when
the Queen and her two sons beheld him, they flew at him as if
they were mad, and tore him to pieces before all the Court, and
began to devour him like raging wolves.&nbsp; Yet still the King
did not know the whole truth.</p>
<p>Then a brother of the King who was thus slain gathered an army
and besieged Romo, who found himself in great danger.&nbsp; One
evening he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is danger within the walls,<br />
The sound of enemies without,<br />
The sun set in blood,<br />
To-morrow it may rise to death.<br />
Would that I had more warriors to fight!<br />
Two hundred fierce and bold;<br />
Two hundred would save us all,<br />
Three hundred would give us full victory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen said nothing, but that night she stole secretly out
of the castle with her sons, and when alone they began to howl,
and soon all the were-wolves in the country assembled.&nbsp; So
the Queen returned with three hundred men, so fierce and wild
that they looked like devils.</p>
<p>They were strange in every way, and talked or howled among
themselves in a horrible language, which, however, the Queen and
her sons seemed to understand.&nbsp; And in the first battle Romo
gained a great victory.&nbsp; And it was observed that the three
hundred men ate the dead.&nbsp; However, the King was well
pleased to conquer.</p>
<p>When Romolo and Remolo were grown up to be men they learned
that in a land not far away were two Princesses named Sabina and
Sabinella, who were the two most beautiful, and also the
strongest, maidens in the world.&nbsp; And it was also made known
that he who would win either must <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>come and conquer her in fight and
carry her away by main strength.</p>
<p>So Romolo and Remolo went to their city, and on an appointed
day the two Princesses appeared in the public place, ready for
the combat.&nbsp; But Romolo advanced with his brother riding on
his shoulders, pick-back, <i>sulle spalle</i>, as boys do, and,
catching up Sabina with one hand and Sabinella with the other, he
ran away like the wind&mdash;so rapidly that he soon distanced
all pursuers.&nbsp; And when Romolo was tired, Remolo took his
place, carrying the sisters and bearing his brother.&nbsp; And
Romolo made a song on it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Up and down the mountain,<br />
Over the fields and through the rivulets,<br />
Over gray rocks and green grass,<br />
I saw a strange beast run;<br />
It had three bodies and three heads,<br />
Six arms and six legs,<br />
Yet did it never run on more than two.<br />
Read the riddle rightly, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two brothers wished to build a new and great city of their
own.&nbsp; They went to a certain goddess, who told them:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The city which ye hope to build will be<br
/>
The greatest ever seen in Italy;<br />
Above all others it will tower sublime,<br />
And rule the world in a far future time;<br />
But know that at the first, ere it can rise,<br />
It calls for blood and human sacrifice.<br />
I know not where the choice or fate doth lie,<br />
But of ye two the one must surely die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, men were greatly wanting for this city, because in those
days there were but few in the land.&nbsp; Then the brothers
assembled many wolves, bears, foxes, and all wild beasts, and by
their power changed them into men.&nbsp; And they did it thus: A
sorcerer took an ox and enchanted it, and slew it, and sang over
it a magic song, and left it in an enchanted place.&nbsp; Then
the wolves and other wild beasts came by night to the great stone
of the sacrifice, by a running stream.&nbsp; A god beheld
it.&nbsp; They ate the meat&mdash;they became men.&nbsp; These
were the first Romans.</p>
<p>Last of all came a serpent with a gold crown&mdash;the Queen
of the Serpents.&nbsp; She ate of the meat and became the most <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>beautiful woman
in the world.&nbsp; She was a great magician.&nbsp; Thus she
became the goddess of the city, and dwelt in the tower of the
temple.&nbsp; And her name was Venus.&nbsp; She was like a
star.</p>
<p>Then Romolo and Remolo wished to know which of them was to die
to save the city.&nbsp; And both desired it.&nbsp; Then they
resolved to take an immense stone and cast it one at the
other.&nbsp; So Remolo picked it up and cast it at his brother,
and all who beheld it thought he must be slain.&nbsp; But Romolo
caught it in his hands and threw it back; yet Remolo caught it
easily.&nbsp; But in that instant his foot slipped, and he fell
backward over the Tarpeian Rock, and so he perished.&nbsp; This
is an old story.</p>
<p>And thus it was that Rome was built.</p>
<p>[Now, it was in this city, or near by, that in after-time
Virgil was born, who in his day did such wonders.&nbsp; But the
first wonder of all was the manner of his birth.&nbsp; For Virgil
was the glory of Rome, and the greatest poet and sorcerer ever
known therein.]</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It did not occur to me to include this tale among the
Virgilian legends, but finding that the compiler of
&ldquo;Virgilius the Sorcerer&rdquo; (1893) has begun with a
legend of Romulus and Remus, I have done the same, having one by
me.&nbsp; As the giant said to the storytelling ram, &ldquo;There
is nothing like beginning at the commencement.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>HOW VIRGIL WAS BORN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And truly this <i>aurum potabile</i>, or
drinkable gold, is a marvellous thing, for it worketh wonders to
sustain human life, removing all disorders, and &rsquo;tis said
that it will revive the dead.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Phil. Ulstadt</span>: <i>C&aelig;lum
Philosophorum</i>, <i>seu Liber de Secretis</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there be magic mirrors in which we may see the
forms of our enemies, and the like, battalions for battle, and
sieges, and all such things.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Peter Goldschmid</span>: <i>The Witch and
Wizard&rsquo;s Advocate overthrown</i> (1705).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was once in an old temple in Rome a great man, a very
learned Signore.&nbsp; His name was Virgilio, or Virgil.&nbsp; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>He was a
magician, but very good in all things to all men; he had a kind
heart, and was ever a friend to the poor.</p>
<p>Virgil was as brave and fearless as he was good.&nbsp; And he
was a famous poet&mdash;his songs were sung all over Italy.&nbsp;
Some say that he was the son of a fairy (<i>fata</i>), and that
his father was a King of the magicians; others declared that his
mother was the most beautiful woman in the whole world, and that
her name was <i>Elena</i> (Helen), and his father was a
spirit.&nbsp; And how it came about was thus:</p>
<p>When all the great lords and princes were in love with the
beautiful Elena, she replied that she would marry no one, having
a great dread of bearing children.&nbsp; She would not become a
mother.&nbsp; And to avoid further wooing and pursuing she shut
herself up in a tower, and believed herself to be in safety,
because it was far without the walls of Rome.&nbsp; And the door
to it was walled up, so that no one could enter it.&nbsp; But the
god Jove (<i>Giove</i>) entered; he did so by changing himself
into many small pieces of gilded paper (gold-leaf), which came
down into the tower like a shower.</p>
<p>The beautiful Helen held in her hand a cup of wine, and many
of the bits of gold-leaf fell into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty it looks!&rdquo; said Helen.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would be a pity to throw it away.&nbsp; The gold does not change
the wine.&nbsp; If I drink the gold I shall enjoy good health and
ever preserve my beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hardly had Helen drunk the wine, before she felt a strange
thrill in all her body, a marvellous rapture, a change of her
whole being, followed by complete exhaustion.&nbsp; And in time
she found herself with child, and cursed the moment when she
drank the wine.&nbsp; And to her in this way was born Virgil, who
had in his forehead a most beautiful star of gold.&nbsp; Three
fairies aided at his birth; the Queen of the Fairies cradled him
in a cradle made of roses.&nbsp; She made a fire of twigs of
laurel; it crackled loudly.&nbsp; To the crackling of twigs of
laurel he was born.&nbsp; His mother felt no pain.&nbsp; The
three each gave him a blessing; the wind as it blew into the
window wished him good fortune; the light of the stars, and the
lamp and the fire, who are all spirits, gave him glory and
song.&nbsp; He was born fair and strong and beautiful; all who
saw him wondered.</p>
<p>Then it happened, when Virgil was fourteen years old, that one
day in summer he went to an old solitary temple, all ruined and
deserted, and therein he laid down to sleep.&nbsp; <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But ere he had
closed his eyes he heard a sound as of a voice lamenting, and it
said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I am a prisoner!<br />
Will no one set me free?<br />
If any man can do it,<br />
Full happy shall he be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Virgil said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me who thou art and where thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the voice answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a spirit,<br />
Imprisoned in a vase<br />
Under the stone<br />
Which is beneath thy head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Virgil lifted the stone and found a vase, which was
closed; and he opened it, and there came forth a beautiful
spirit, who told him that there was also in the vase a book of
magic and necromancy (<i>magia e gramanzia</i>).</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Therein wilt thou find all secrets<br />
Which thou desirest to obtain,<br />
To make what thou wilt into gold,<br />
To make the dead speak,<br />
To make them come before thee,<br />
To go invisibly where thou wilt,<br />
To become a great poet.<br />
Thou wilt learn the lost secret<br />
How to become great and beautiful;<br />
Thou wilt rediscover the mystery<br />
Of predicting what is to take place;<br />
Yea, to win fortune in every game.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the vase was a magic wand, the most powerful ever
known.&nbsp; And from that day Virgil, who had been as small as a
dwarf, became a tall, stately, very handsome man.</p>
<p>This was his first great work: he made a mirror wherein one
could see all that was going on in any country in the world, in
any city, as well into any house as anywhere.&nbsp; Keeping the
mirror hidden (beneath his cloak), he went to the Emperor.&nbsp;
And because he was a very handsome man, well dressed, and also by
the aid of the mirror, he was permitted to go into the hall where
the Emperor sat.&nbsp; And, conversing with him, the Emperor was
so pleased that he spoke more familiarly and confidentially than
he was wont to do with his best friends; at which the courtiers
who were present were angry with jealousy.</p>
<p>Turning to Virgil, the Emperor said:</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>&ldquo;I
would give a thousand gold crowns to know just what the Turks are
doing now, and if they mean to make war on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virgil replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your Highness will go into another room, I can show
in secret what the Turks are now doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how you can make me see what the Turks are doing is
more than I can understand,&rdquo; replied the Emperor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, let us go, if it be only to see what fancy thou
hast in thy head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Emperor rose, and giving his arm to Virgil, went to a
room apart, where the magician showed and explained to him
(<i>per filo e per segna</i>) all that the Turks were
about.&nbsp; And the Emperor was amazed at seeing clearly what
Virgil had promised to show.&nbsp; Then he gave to Virgil the
thousand crowns with his own hand, and was ever from that day his
friend.&nbsp; And so Virgil rose in the world.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this tale there is as quaint and na&iuml;ve a mixture of
traditions and ideas as one could desire.&nbsp; The fair Helen,
in her tower of Troy, becomes Danae visited by Jupiter, and as
the narrator had certainly seen Dantzic Golden Water, or some
other cordial with gold-leaf in it, the story of the shower is
changed into aureated wine.&nbsp; It is evident that the one who
recast the legend endeavoured to make this incident
intelligible.&nbsp; All the rest is medi&aelig;val.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; says Helen, &ldquo;will preserve my
beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the <i>aurum potabile</i> of the
alchemists was supposed to do the same as Paracelsus
declared.</p>
<p>We all recognise a great idea when put into elaborate form by
a skilled artist, but to perceive it as a diamond in the rough
and recognise its value is apparently given to few.&nbsp; It is
true that those few may themselves be neither poets nor
geniuses&mdash;just as the Hottentot who can find or discern
diamonds may be no lapidary or jeweller.&nbsp; What I would say
is, that such ideas or motives abound in this Italian witch-lore
to a strange extent.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Thus, the
making Virgil a son of Jupiter by a Helen-Danae is a flight of
mythologic invention, far surpassing in boldness anything given
in the Neapolitan legends of the poet.&nbsp; Thomas Carlyle and
Vernon Lee have expressed with great skill great admiration of
the idea that Faust begat with the fair Helen the
Renaissance.&nbsp; It was indeed a magnificent conception, but in
very truth this fathering of Virgil, the grand type of poetry and
magic, and of all earthly wisdom, by Jupiter on Helen-Danae is
far superior to it in every way.&nbsp; For Virgil to the
legend-maker represented the Gothic or Middle Ages in all their
beauty and exuberance, their varied learning and splendid
adventure, far more perfectly than did the mere vulgar juggler
and thaumaturgist Faust, as the latter appears in every legend
until Goethe transfigured him.&nbsp; And, strangely enough, the
Virgilian cyclus, as I have given it, is as much of the
Renaissance as it is classic or medi&aelig;val.&nbsp; The Medicis
are in it to the life.&nbsp; In very truth it was Virgil, and not
Faust, who was the typical magician <i>par &eacute;minence</i>
after Apollonius, some of whose legends he, in fact,
inherited.&nbsp; And Virgil has come to us with a traditional
character as marked and peculiar as any in
Shakespeare&mdash;which Faust did not.&nbsp; He has passed
through the ages not only as a magus and poet, but as a
personality, and a very remarkable one.</p>
<p>There is another very curious, and, indeed, great idea lurking
in these witch-Virgilian legends, especially set forth in this of
the birth and continued in all.&nbsp; It is that there is in them
a cryptic, latent heathenism, a sincere, lingering love of the
old gods, and especially of the <i>dii minores</i>, of
<i>fate</i> or fays, and fauns and fairies, of spirits of the air
and of rivers and fountains, an adoration <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of Diana as the
moon-queen of the witches, and a far greater familiarity with
incantations than prayers, or more love of sorceries than
sacraments.&nbsp; Whenever it can be done, even as a
post-scriptum, we have a conjuration or spell, as if the tale had
awakened in the mind of the narrator a feeling of piety towards
&ldquo;the old religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The romances of Mercury,
and Janus, and Vesta, and Apollo, and Diana all inspire the
narrator to pray to them in all sincerity, just as a Catholic,
after telling a legend of a saint, naturally repeats a prayer to
him or a novena.&nbsp; It is the last remains of classic
faith.</p>
<p>Or we may say, as things fell out, that the
Goethean-Helen-Faust-Renaissance poem represents things as they
were, or as they came to pass, as if it were the acme, while the
Virgilian tradition which I here impart indicates things as they
might have happened, had the stream of evolution been allowed to
run on in its natural course, just as Julian the apostate (or
rather apostle of the gospel of letting things be) held that
progress or culture and science might have advanced just as
surely and rapidly on the old heathen lines as any other.&nbsp;
According to Heine, this would have saved us all an immense
amount of trouble in our school-studies, in learning Latin and
mythology, had we kept on as we were.</p>
<p>I mean by this that these traditions of Virgil indicate, as no
other book does, the condition of a na&iuml;vely heathen mind,
&ldquo;suckled in a creed out-worn,&rdquo; believing in the
classic mythology half turned to fairies, much more sincerely, I
fear, than many of my readers do in the Bible, and from this we
may gather very curious reflection as to whether men may not have
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>ideas of
culture, honesty, and mercy in common, whatever their religion
may be.</p>
<p>The marvels of the birth of Virgil of old, as told by Donatus,
probably after the lost work of Suetonius, are that his mother
Maia dreamed, <i>se enixam laureum ramum</i>, that she gave birth
to a branch of laurel; that he did not cry when born, and that
the pine-tree planted according to ancient custom on that
occasion attained in a very short time to a great height, which
thing often happens when plants grow near hot springs, as is the
case on the Margariten Island, by Budapesth, where everything
attains to full-size in one-third of the usual time.&nbsp; The
custom of planting a pine-tree on the birth of a child, in the
belief that its condition will always indicate its
subject&rsquo;s health and prosperity, is still common among the
Passamaquoddy, and other Red Indians in America, I having had
such a tree pointed out to me by an old grandfather.</p>
<p>In the Aryan or Hindu mythology Buddha, who subsequently
becomes a great <i>magus</i> and healer of all ills, like Christ,
&ldquo;was born of the mother-tree Maya,&rdquo; according to J.
F. Hewitt (&ldquo;L&rsquo;Histoire et les Migrations de la Croix
et du Su-astika,&rdquo; Bruxelles, 1898).&nbsp; He was the son of
Kapila Vastu, who was born holding in his hands a medicament,
whence he became &ldquo;the Child of Medicine,&rdquo; or of
healing.&nbsp; Buddha appears to be confused with his father.</p>
<p>Now Virgil is clearly stated to be born of Maya or Maia, who
is a mythical tree; his life is involved in that of a mysterious
tree, and in more than one legend he is unquestionably identical
with Esculapius, the god of medicine.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>VIRGIL, THE EMPEROR, AND THE TWO DOVES.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Qualis spelunca subito commota Columba,<br
/>
Cui domus, et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi,<br />
Fertur in arva volans, plausumque exterrita pennis<br />
Dat tecto ingentem; mox &aelig;re lapsa quieto<br />
Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Virgilius</span>: <i>Aen.</i>, V. 213.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another story, telling how Virgil first met the
Emperor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It happened on a time that the Emperor of Rome invited many of
his friends to a hunt, and on the appointed day all assembled
with fine horses and hounds, gay attendants, and sounding
horns&mdash;<i>tutti allegri e contenti</i>, &ldquo;all as gay as
larks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they came to the place, they left their horses and
went into the forest, where it befell, as usual, that some got
game, while others returned lame; but on the whole they came to
camp with full bags and many brags of their adventures and
prowess, and supped merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ever so,&rdquo; said the Emperor to a courtier,
&ldquo;one stumbles, and another grumbles; then the next minute
something joyful comes, and he smiles.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thus it is true in every land<br />
Good luck and bad go hand in hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When men speak in that tone,&rdquo; replied the
courtier, &ldquo;they often prophesy.&nbsp; Now, there is near by
an ancient grotto, long forgot by men, wherein if you will sleep
you may have significant dreams, even as people had in the olden
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when night came on some of the courtiers went to a
contadino house to lodge, while others camped out <i>alla
stella</i>, or in the <i>albergo al fresco</i>, while the Emperor
was guided by the courtier to an old ruin, where in a solid rock
there was a door of stone, which Virgil opened by a spell.&nbsp;
(<i>Sic</i> in MS.)</p>
<p>The Emperor was then led through a long passage into a cave,
which was dry and comfortable enough, and where the attendants
made a bed, whereon His Highness lay down, and, being very weary,
was soon asleep.</p>
<p>But he had not slumbered long ere, as it seemed to him, he was
awakened by the loud barking of a dog, and saw <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>before him to
his amazement a marvellously beautiful lady clad in white, with a
resplendent star (crescent) on her forehead.&nbsp; In her right
hand she bore a white dove, and in her left another, which was
black.</p>
<p>When the lady, or goddess, saw that the Emperor was awake, she
let both the doves fly.&nbsp; The white one, after circling
several times round his head, alighted on his shoulder.&nbsp; The
black one also flew about him, and then winged its course far
away.</p>
<p>Then the lady disappeared, and the white dove followed her,
and sat on her shoulder as she fled.</p>
<p>The Emperor was so much amazed, or deeply moved, by this
strange sight that he slept no more, but remained all night
meditating on it, nor did he on the morrow give any heed to the
chase, but ever reflected on the lady and her doves.</p>
<p>The courtier asked him what had occurred.&nbsp; And the
Emperor replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a wonderful vision, and I cannot tell the
meaning thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is in Rome a young man, a poet and sage, of whom
I have heard strange things, and I believe that he excels in
unfolding signs and mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied the Emperor.&nbsp; So when
they returned to Rome he sent for the magician, who came, yet he
knew beforehand why he was summoned to Court.&nbsp; And it is
said that this was the first time when the Emperor knew Virgil.
<a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>Now, Virgil was as yet a young man.&nbsp; And when the Emperor
set forth what he had beheld, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a marvellously favourable sign for you, oh my
Emperor, for in that lady you have seen your star.&nbsp; There is
a planet allotted to every man, and thine is of the
greatest.&nbsp; Thou hast one&mdash;call to her, invoke her ever
when in need of help, and she will never abandon thee.&nbsp; Thou
hast seen thy star.&nbsp; Her greeting to thee (<i>saluto</i>)
means that a year hence a danger will threaten thee.&nbsp; The
black dove signifies that one year hence thou wilt have an enemy
who will make war on thee.&nbsp; When the dove fled afar, it was
not the dove but the enemy, who will be put to <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>flight.&nbsp;
And the white dove was not a dove, but your victory announced to
you in that form, and your star has announced it because in one
year you will have, as the proverb says, &lsquo;the enemy at your
heels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all this came to pass as he had foretold.</p>
<p>Then the poet and magician became his friend, and from that
time the Emperor never moved a leaf (<i>i.e.</i> did nothing)
without taking the advice of Virgil.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The goddess, or planet, described in this tale is very
evidently Diana, appropriately introduced as the deity of the
chase, but more significantly as the queen of the witches, and
mistress of mysteries and divination.&nbsp; In both forms the dog
has a peculiar adaptation, because a black dog was the common
attendant of a sorcerer, as exampled by that of Henry C.
Agrippa.</p>
<p>The dove is so widely spread in this world, and is everywhere
so naturally recognised as a pretty, innocent creature, that it
is no wonder that very different and distant races should have
formed much the same ideas and traditions regarding it.&nbsp; It
is a curious anomaly that while doves, especially in Roman
Catholic symbolism, are the special symbols of love and peace,
there are in reality no animals or birds which fight and peck so
assiduously among themselves, as I have verified by much
observation.&nbsp; However, herein the pious mythologists
&ldquo;builded better than they knew,&rdquo; for the <i>odium
theologicum</i>, either with heretics or among rivals in the
Church, has been the cause of more quarrelling than any other in
the world&mdash;woman perhaps excepted.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian symbolism, a widow who, out of love for her
husband, will not wed again was typified by a black dove. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; The dove who brought the
olive-leaf <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>to Noah was generally recognised as symbolizing the new
birth of the world, or its regeneration after a divine bath or
lustration, and the same meaning is attached to its appearance at
the baptism of Christ.&nbsp; A German writer named Wernsdorf has
written two books on the dove as a symbol, viz., &ldquo;De
simulacro columb&aelig; in locis sacris antiquitas
recepto,&rdquo; Viterbo, 1773; and &ldquo;De Columba
auricul&aelig; Gregorii adh&aelig;rente,&rdquo; Witteberg,
1780.</p>
<p>As Diana always bears the crescent, here confounded or
identified very naturally with a star&mdash;both being heavenly
bodies&mdash;the representing her as the peculiar planet of the
Emperor is very ingenious.&nbsp; In seeing her he beholds his
star, and, in the mute language of emblems, hears her
voice.&nbsp; Truly there is unto all of us a star, but it is
within and not without, and its name is the Will, which, when
revealed or understood, can work miracles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mote it be!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VIRGILIO AND THE ROCK.</h2>
<p>One night, when he was young, Virgil was in Naples; he went to
visit a very beautiful woman.&nbsp; And when he left her at
midnight he found the house surrounded by <i>bravi</i> or
assassins, who had been placed there to kill him by a signore who
was his rival.</p>
<p>Then the magician ran for his life, followed by all the crew,
till he came to a steep rock like a high wall.&nbsp; And here he
paused, and cried aloud during the minute which he had gained,
this incantation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Apri spirito della rupe,<br />
Apri il tuo cuore a me.<br />
Spirito gentile, abbi,<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Abbi
piet&agrave; di me,<br />
Se tu vuoi che Iddio<br />
Abbia piet&agrave; di te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty spirit of the mountain,<br />
Ope thy rocky heart to me.<br />
Gentle sprite, I pray thee<br />
Have mercy upon me,<br />
As thou truly hopest<br />
That God may pity thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the rock opened, and Virgil fled into it and was
saved.</p>
<p>Those who sought his life followed.&nbsp; And Virgil went
forth, but while they were in the passage it closed at both ends,
and they all perished.&nbsp; So was Virgil saved.</p>
<p>It came to pass in time that Virgil, seeing it would be of
great use, opened the grotto, and it is there to this day.</p>
<p>There was no place where Virgil did not leave some great work,
whence it came that his name is known to all the world.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a curious reflection, and one of great value to
folk-lore, to be drawn from this, and in fact from all of these
stories.&nbsp; It is believed&mdash;actually believed, and not
merely assumed to make a tale&mdash;that the conjurations given
in them have the effect attributed to them when they are uttered
by any wizard or witch or person who is prepared by magic or
faith.&nbsp; Therefore such tales as told by witches are only a
frame, as it were, wherein a lesson-picture is set.&nbsp; This
induces a deeper, hence a more advanced, kind of reflection or
moral than is conveyed by common, popular fairy-tales.&nbsp; The
one condition naturally leads to another.&nbsp; There is very
little trace of it in the &ldquo;M&auml;hrchen&rdquo; of Grimm,
Crane, Pitr&eacute;, or Bernoni.&nbsp; In the <i>novelle</i> of
Boccacio, Sachetti, Bandello and others, of which literally
thousands were produced during and after the Renaissance, there
is very often a commonplace <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>kind of moral, such as follows all
fables, but it is not of the same kind as that which is involved
in witch-stories.&nbsp; Even in this of Virgil the invocation to
the Spirit of the Rock, adjuring it to be merciful as it hopes
for mercy from God, is beyond what is generally found in common
traditions.</p>
<p>All of these conjurations, to have due effect, must be intoned
in a certain manner, which is so peculiar that anyone who is
familiar with it can recognise at a distance, where the words are
not to be distinguished, by the mere sound of the voice, whether
an incantation is being sung.&nbsp; Hence the greatest care and
secresy is observed when teaching or chanting them.</p>
<p>Among the Red Indians of North America this is carried so far
that, as one who took lessons from an Oneida sorcerer informs us,
it required study every day for seven years to learn how to
correctly intone one spell of twelve lines.&nbsp; The same is
told of the old Etruscan-Latin spells in the &ldquo;<i>Dizionario
Myth. Storico</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This legend is specially interesting because the tomb of
Virgil is close by the grotto of Posillippo, and it is
conjectured that as it was, according to tradition, made by
magic, Virgil probably made it.&nbsp; Therefore it may have been
the first of these tales.&nbsp; Why the grotto was specially
regarded as mysterious is almost apparent to all who have studied
cave and stone worship.&nbsp; In early times, in the mysteries,
the going through a hole or passage, especially in a rock,
signified the new birth, or illumination, or initiation, hence
the cult of holy or holed stones, great or small, found all over
the world.&nbsp; Such writers as Faber and Bryant have, it is
true, somewhat overdone guess-work symbolism, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>or fanciful
interpretation, but that the passing through the dark tunnel and
coming to light played a part in old rites is unquestionable, and
that this respect for the subject extended to all perforated
stones and even beads.</p>
<p>Incantations or spells are of two kinds&mdash;the traditional,
and those which a powerful or gifted magician or witch
improvises.&nbsp; This of Virgil is of the latter kind.</p>
<h2>VIRGIL, THE EMPEROR, AND THE TRUFFLES.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Quo ducit gula?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Latin
Saying</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am passionately fond of truffles, though I never
tasted them.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Xavier de
Montepin</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day Virgil was at table with the Emperor, and the latter
complained that his cook was a dolt, because he could never find
anything new to tempt his appetite, and that he had to eat the
same kind of dishes over and over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I would like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be some
kind of new taste or flavour.&nbsp; There must be many a one as
yet unknown to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Virgil, reflecting, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see to-morrow if I cannot find something of the
kind which will please your Highness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon all
who were present expressed delight, for no one doubted that he
could do whatever he attempted.</p>
<p>So the next day Virgil went into the forests, where there were
many pigs, and considered attentively what the roots might be
which they dug up with such great care; for he had remarked that
whatever men eat pigs also like, above all other animals.&nbsp;
And having obtained some of the roots, which were like dark-brown
or black lumps, he took them to the Emperor&rsquo;s cook, and
said:</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;Wash these well and cut them fine, and I will see
to the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day the Emperor had invited several friends to see what
new dish Virgil would produce; and when they were assembled at
table, Virgilio took the roots, cut fine, put them into a pan
with oil and beaten eggs, and served them up with his own
hands.&nbsp; And the smell thereof was so appetizing that all
cried, &ldquo;<i>Evviva Virgilio</i>!&rdquo; even before they had
tasted the dish.&nbsp; But when they had eaten of it, they were
delighted indeed, and one and all wished to know what the roots
were which gave such a delicate flavour; to which Virgil, rising,
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truffles!&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>And ever since that time, even at the table of the Pope, or
any other rich man, no one has ever discovered any better flavour
for food than this which was first found out by Virgil.</p>
<p>One day not long after this took place Virgil was in his
study, when, looking at the stone in a ring which he wore, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;The Emperor wishes to see me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
sure enough, a few minutes later a messenger entered, saying that
his imperial master desired to speak to the sage.&nbsp; And,
having obeyed the call, he found the Emperor ill and suffering
from an indigestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caro Virgilio</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed the Emperor,
&ldquo;I have made thee come because I am suffering from
disorder; and as that pig of a cook who caused it can give me
nothing to eat to relieve it, I have recourse to science, for I
know that thou art a great doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; replied Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very simple
doctoring is needed here.&nbsp; Just tell the cook to boil
wheat-bran in water, mix it with the yolk of an egg, and drink it
in the morning before you rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bran boiled in water!&rdquo; repeated the Emperor
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just what they give to pigs!&nbsp; Truly, it
seems that you have brought me down to a pig&rsquo;s level, since
you give me &lsquo;hogs&rsquo; broth,&rsquo; as they call
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; exclaimed Virgil, &ldquo;since your
Highness is so humble, that you do not put yourself below the
pigs, because you have abused like a pig, and many a time, that
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>poor devil
of a cook for not pleasing your palate.&nbsp; It is not long
since I delighted you, and had applause from all, for serving
truffles at your imperial table.&nbsp; Had <i>he</i> done so, you
would have curiously inquired what the roots were and whence they
came; and having learned that they were <i>cibo di maiali</i>, or
pigs&rsquo; food, you would have cast him forth, and the truffles
after him.&nbsp; For such is the wisdom of this world, and so is
man deluded!&nbsp; But as for the bran boiled in water, whether
it be pigs&rsquo; broth or not, &rsquo;tis the specific for your
illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, my dear Virgilio,&rdquo; replied the Emperor,
&ldquo;in future serve me up as many pigs&rsquo; dainties and
give me as much pigs&rsquo;-doctor stuff as you please, provided
that all be as good as truffles, or the medicine bran
broth.&nbsp; It is foolish to be led by mere fancies: a pig or a
peasant may know as well as a prince what is pleasant for the
palate or good as a cure.&nbsp; <i>Evviva
Virgilio</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this merry tale I have followed to the letter an undoubted
original, which was in every detail new to me; and this is the
more remarkable since there is in it decidedly the stamp and
expression of a kind of humour and philosophy which seems to be
peculiar to individual or literary genius.&nbsp; The joke of
pigs&rsquo; dainties, pigs&rsquo; remedies, the calling the cook
a pig, and the final reduction of the Emperor to a degree below
that animal, is carried out with great ingenuity, yet as marked
simplicity.</p>
<p>The best truffles in Italy are sold as coming from
<i>Norcia</i>, and Nortia, who was an old Etruscan goddess, known
to the original Virgil, is in popular tradition in Tuscany the
Spirit of Truffles, to whom those who seek them address a
<i>scongiurazione</i>, or evocation, which may be found in my
&ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Christian symbolism
the truffle is associated with St. Antony and his pig.&nbsp; When
the saint had resolved to die by hunger, the pig dug up and
brought to him a <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>number of truffles, the saint seeing in this an
intimation by a miracle that he should eat and live, which thing
would seem to be poetically commemorated in the <i>saucisses aux
truffes</i>, or Gotha sausages, in which pork and truffles are
beautifully combined.</p>
<p>The most remarkable variety of the truffle is one found in the
United States, south of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; It is called
<i>tuckahoe</i>, or Indian bread, and, with most things American,
is remarkable for bigness at least, since it weighs sometimes
fifteen pounds and hides at a depth of fifteen feet
underground.&nbsp; Like California fruit, it is far more
remarkable for size or weight than excellence.&nbsp; An
incredible quantity of so-called truffles, which appear thinly
sliced or in small bits in dishes even in first-class hotels or
restaurants all over Europe, are nothing but burned potatoes, or
similar vegetable carbon, flavoured sometimes with extract of
mushrooms, but much oftener are simply tasteless soft coal.&nbsp;
Very good truffles, equal to the French, for which they are sold,
are found in the South of England.&nbsp; The truffle is, like raw
meat, caviare, and oysters, strongly stimulating food, and as a
<i>pur&eacute;e</i> or paste is beneficial for an&aelig;mic
invalids.</p>

21</span>BALS&Agrave;BO.</h2>
<p>There once lived in Florence in the days of King Long-Ago or
Queen Formerly a signore who went beyond all the men who ever
sinned, in making evil out of good and turning light into
darkness.&nbsp; For, under cover of being very devout and serving
the saints, he well-nigh outdid many a devil in making all about
him unhappy.&nbsp; He had six children, three boys and three
girls, all as fine young folk as there were in Tuscany.&nbsp; For
he was severe in punishing and slow in rewarding, always
reviling, never giving a kind word.&nbsp; Once when his eldest
son saved him from drowning at the risk of his own life, he
abused and struck the youth for tearing his garment in so
doing.&nbsp; And in his family there was ever the wolf at the
table with such a hunger that one could see it, <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a> while all save himself went so sorrily
clad that it was a shame to behold, and if anyone made a jest or
so much as smiled there came abuse and blows.&nbsp; And to offend
and grieve and insult was so deeply in him that it became a
disease.</p>
<p>However, evil weeds must fade as well as flowers; everything
dies except Death, and the longer time he takes to sharpen his
scythe, the more keenly will it cut.&nbsp; So it came to pass
that one day this good man, but very bad parent, came suddenly to
his death-bed, while his children stood round with eyes as dry as
the Arno in August, which, though it may shine here and there,
never runs over. <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>Now, by chance there stood by the dying man the great magician
Virgilio, who indeed had much love and pity for these young
people.&nbsp; And at the same minute, but seen only by him, there
came floating in, like a bit of gold-leaf on a light feather,
borne on the current of air, a certain <i>folletto</i>, or devil,
who had been drifting about in the world for a thousand years,
and in all that time had only learned more and more that
everything is naught, or nothing of much consequence, and that
good or evil stand for one <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>another, according to
circumstances.&nbsp; And as the dying man was one who, above all
people living, made the meanest trifle a thing of vast
importance, so this devil, whose name was Bals&agrave;bo, went
beyond all his own kind of <i>diavoli pococuranti</i> in being
unlike the great Signore di Tribaldo (as the dead man was
called), he being a <i>diavolo a dirittura</i>, a devil in a
straight line, or directly forward.&nbsp; And this demon being
invisible to all save Virgil, the master said to him
secretly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou willing to enter this man&rsquo;s body and act
as his soul, and become father of a family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As ready for that as for anything.&nbsp; No doubt I
will find fun in it,&rdquo; answered Bals&agrave;bo.</p>
<p>Then Virgil said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Spirito di Bels&agrave;bo,<br />
Io ti scongiur&ograve;<br />
Che per comando mio<br />
Tu lasci una vita sfrenata<br />
Come &rsquo;ai tenuto per il passato<br />
E dentro il corpo di Tribaldo<br />
Tu possa entrare e divenire<br />
Un capo di famiglia<br />
Fino a ordine mio.<br />
E tutti quei<br />
Fanciulli educherai (<i>sic</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit of Bels&agrave;bo,<br />
I now conjure thee<br />
That by my command<br />
Thou shalt leave the lewd life<br />
Which thou did&rsquo;st lead of old,<br />
And enter into this body<br />
Of Di Tribaldo, and become<br />
Head of a family,<br />
And educate his children.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So into the body he went, as the spirit of Di Tribaldo went
out, like the toy which shows the weather in which one puppet
pops forth as the other goes in.&nbsp; So there he lay for a
minute, all the children around in silent amazement that he had
departed without cursing them.&nbsp; When all at once up leaped
Bals&agrave;bo, as gay as a lark, crying like a
<i>Scaramuccio</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop, pigs! here we are again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing which, the dear children, understanding that he had
come to life again, did indeed weep bitterly, so that <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Di Tribaldo,
had he stopped a little longer, might have been amazed.&nbsp; But
he had no sooner gone out of his body than a great grim devil, a
kind of detective demon, who was on the look-out for souls,
whipped him up, gave him a couple of cuffs to keep him quiet,
and, putting him into a game-bag, drawing the cords tight, and
then rolling them round and tying them, flew off to give the prey
up to the proper authorities, and what disposition they made of
this precious piece of property I know not, nor truly do I much
care.&nbsp; All that can be said is that &rsquo;twas a good
riddance of bad rubbish, and that we may all rejoice that he
comes no more into this story.</p>
<p>But what was the amazement of the well-nigh bereaved children
when their solemn parent made a leap half-way to the ceiling, and
then, while imitating with his mouth a <i>zufolo</i>, or
shepherd&rsquo;s pipe, to perfection, began to dance with grace a
wild <i>coranto</i>, and anon sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chi ben vive, ben muore,<br />
Io lo credo in mio cuore;<br />
Oggi vivo, in figura,<br />
E doman in sepoltura,<br />
Ho scappato ben il orco,<br />
Morto io, morto il porco!&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;He who lives well may well depart,<br />
As I believe with all my heart.<br />
To-day alive, and all in bloom,<br />
To-morrow buried in the tomb;<br />
But I&rsquo;ve escaped, and don&rsquo;t care why! <br />
If I were dead the pig might die!<br />
The pig might die, the world be burned!<br />
And everything to ashes turned!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which pious song being ended, he asked them why they were all
staring at him like a party of stuck pigs, and bade them scamper
and send out for a good supper, with flowers and wine; and on
their asking what he would have, he replied, still singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Everything to please the palate,<br />
Venison, woodcocks, larks, and sallet,<br />
Partridges both wild and tame,<br />
And every other kind of game,<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Buttered
eggs and macaroni,<br />
Salmagundi, rice and honey,<br />
Mince-pies and oyster too,<br />
Lobster patties, veal rago&ucirc;t,<br />
Beef, with mushrooms round the dish,<br />
And everything that heart could wish.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereupon, being told by his eldest daughter, who was of
opinion that he had gone mad, that such a supper would cost
twenty crowns, he replied that it could not be done for the
money, and that he should always expect such a meal every day,
and a much better one when guests should come.&nbsp; Wherein he
kept his word, and amazed them all by urging them to stuff and
cram to their hearts&rsquo; desire, but especially by pressing
them to drink; and whereas it had been of yore that they had been
scolded like beasts if they so much as begged for a second glass
of sour, half-watered wine, they were now jeered and jibed as
duffers and sticks for not swigging off their bumpers of the best
and strongest like men.</p>
<p>And they also noted a great change in this, that while the
late Signore Tribaldo had ever been as severe in manner and
conversation as any saint, and grim as an old owl, the Signore
Bals&agrave;bo during the meal cracked one joke after the other,
some of them none too seemly, and roared with laughter at their
frightened looks.&nbsp; But as &rsquo;tis easy to teach young
cats the way to the dairy, they began to slowly put out one paw
after the other, and be of the opinion that on the whole their
dear papa had been much improved by his death and revival.&nbsp;
And some word having been said of games, he suddenly whipped out
a pack of cards and proposed play.&nbsp; At which his eldest son
replying that it would be but a thin game with them who had
hardly a <i>quattrino</i> apiece, Bals&agrave;bo sent for his
strong-box, which was indeed well-lined, and gave them each a
hundred crowns in gold, swearing it was a shame that such a
magnificent family as his should go about like poor beggars,
because handsome youth and beautiful girls needed fine clothes,
and that in future they were all to spend what they
liked&mdash;and bless the expense at that!&mdash;for as long as
there was twopence in the locker, half of it should be
theirs.</p>
<p>Then they sat down to play, and Gianni, the eldest son, and
Bianca, the eldest daughter, who had aforetime learned to play a
little on the sly, thought they would surely win.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>But
Bals&agrave;bo in the end beat them all, and when they marvelled
at his luck roared with laughter, and said &rsquo;twas no wonder,
for he had cheated at every turn; and then, sitting down again,
showed them how &rsquo;twas done, but bade them keep it all a
family secret.&nbsp; &ldquo;For thus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
can among us cheat all the gamesters in Florence, and ever be as
rich as so many Cardinals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he said to them, as in apology: &ldquo;Ye have no
doubt, my dear children, marvelled that I have this evening been
somewhat strict and austere with you, which is not to be blamed,
considering that I have been dead and am only just now alive
again; but I trust that in future I shall be far more kind and
indulgent, and lend you a helping hand in all your little games,
whatever they be; for the only thing which can grieve me is that
there shall be any fun or devilry going on, and I not have a hand
in it.&nbsp; And as it is becoming that children should obey
their parents, and have no secrets from them, I enjoin it
strictly on you that whatever you may be up to, from swindling at
pitch-and-toss, up to manslaughter or duels, ye do nothing
without first taking counsel with me, because I, being more
experienced in the ways of this wicked world, can best guard you
against its deceptions.&nbsp; And so, my beloved infants, go in
peace, which means go it while you are young, and as peacefully
as you can, and merrily if you must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the eldest son, Gianni, had longed well nigh to being
ill, and even to tears, to wear fine clothes (in which Bianca and
the others were well up with him), and have a gallant horse, like
the other youths of his rank in Florence.&nbsp; But kind as
Bals&agrave;bo had been to him, he hardly dared to broach the
subject, when all at once his father introduced it by asking him
why he went footing about like a pitiful beggar, instead of
riding like a cavalier; and learning that it was because he had
no steed, Bals&agrave;bo gave a long whistle and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a fool of forty-five degrees!&nbsp; Why
the devil, if you thought I would not approve it, did you not buy
a horse on post-obit credit, and ride him on the sly?&nbsp;
However, &rsquo;tis never too late to mend.&nbsp; But such a
goose as you would be certainly cheated in the buying.&nbsp; Come
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Gianni soon found that his saint of a father was well up
to all the tricks of the horse trade, the end being that he had
the best steed in Florence for half of what it would have <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>cost
him.&nbsp; And from this accomplished parent he also learned to
ride and fence, and in the latter he taught his son so many sly
passes and subtle tricks, crafty glissades and <i>botte</i>, that
he had not his master in all the land.</p>
<p>And now a strange thing came to pass: that as all these young
people, though willing enough to be gay and well attired, were
good at heart and honest, as they day by day found that their
father, though really bad in nothing, had, on the other hand, no
more conscience or virtue than an old shoe or a rag scarecrow, so
it was they who began to sermonize him, even as the late Signore
Tribaldo had lectured them, the tables being quite turned.&nbsp;
But what was most marvellous was that Signore Bals&agrave;bo, far
from taking any offence, seemed to find in this being scolded for
his want of heart, morals, and other crimes, a deep and wondrous
joy, a sweet delight, as of one who has discovered a new pleasure
or great treasure.&nbsp; This was especially the case when he was
brought to book, or hauled over the coals, by his daughter
Bianca, who was gifted with the severe eloquence of her other
father, which she now poured forth in floods on his
successor.</p>
<p>Now, you may well imagine that an old devil-goblin who had
been kicked and footed about the world for a thousand years
between the back-kitchen of hell unto the inner courts of the
Vatican, including all kinds of life, but especially the bad,
thus having a family to support and beloved daughters and sons to
blow him up, and, in fact, the mere having any decent Christian
care enough for him to call him a soulless old blackguard, was
like undreamed-of bliss.&nbsp; He had been in his time exorcised
by priests in Latin through all that grammar and vocabulary could
supply, and cursed in Etruscan, Greek, Lombard, and everything
else; but the Italian of his daughter had in it the exquisite and
novel charm that there was real <i>love</i> mingled with it and
gratitude for his profuse kindness and indulgence, so that
&rsquo;twas to him like the pecking of an angry and dear canary
bird, the which thing acted on him so strangely that he at times
was fain to look about him for some stray sin to commit, in order
to get a good sound scolding.&nbsp; For he had fallen so much
into decent life and ways by living with his dear children that
it often happened that he did nothing wrong for as much as three
or four days together.</p>
<p>And truly it was a brave sight to see him, when reprimanded,
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>cast down
his eyes and sigh: &ldquo;Yes, yes! &rsquo;tis too true: <i>mea
culpa</i>! <i>mea maxima culpa</i>!&nbsp; It was indeed
wicked!&rdquo; when all the while he hardly knew where the sin
was or wherein he had done wrong or right or anything else.&nbsp;
Now, it may seem a strange thing that so old a sinner should ever
come to grace; but as ye know that in old tombs raspberry or
other seeds, hard and dry, a thousand years old, have been found
which, however, grew when planted, so Bals&agrave;bo began to
think and change, and try, even for curiosity&rsquo;s sake, what
being good meant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was a marvel to see how
well&mdash;notwithstanding all the expenditure, to which there
was no limit, save the consciences of the
children&mdash;Bals&agrave;bo kept the treasury supplied.&nbsp;
And this was to him a joke, as all life was, save, indeed, the
children, in whom he began to take interest, or for whom he felt
love; for, what with knowing where many an old treasure lay
hidden, or the true value of many a cheap estate, and a hundred
other devices and tricks, he ever gained so much that in time he
gave great dowers to his daughters, and castles and lands, with
titles, to his sons.</p>
<p>Now, it came to pass&mdash;and it was the greatest marvel of
all&mdash;that Bianca, by her reproving and reforming
Bals&agrave;bo, had her own heart turned to goodness, and gave
herself up to good works and study and prayer; and unto her
studies Bals&agrave;bo, curiously interested, gave great
aid.&nbsp; Then she learned marvellously deep secrets of magic
and spirits, but nothing evil; and it came to pass that in her
books she found that there were beings born of the elements,
creatures appointed to live a thousand years or more, and then
pass away into air or fire, and exist no longer.&nbsp;
Furthermore, she discovered that such wandering spirits sometimes
took up their abode in human bodies, and that, being neither good
nor bad, they were always wild and strange, given up of all
things to quaint tricks and strange devices, as ready unto one
thing as another.</p>
<p>And it came to her mind, as she noted how Bals&agrave;bo knew
all languages, and spoke of things which took place ages before
as if he had lived in them, and of men long dead as if he had
known them, that he who was her father aforetime was ignorant of
all this as he was of gentleness or kindness or good nature, all
which Bals&agrave;bo carried to a fault, not caring to take the
pains to injure his worst enemy or to do a good turn to his best
friend, unless it amused him, in which <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>case he would kill the one with as
little sorrow as if he were a fly, and give the other a castle or
a thousand crowns, and think no more of it than if he had fed a
hawk or a hound.&nbsp; And all such good deeds he played off in
some droll fashion, like tricks, as if thinking that sport, and
nothing else, was the end and aim of all benevolence.&nbsp;
However, as regarded Bianca and her brothers and sisters, he
seemed to have other ideas, and to her he appeared to be as
another being, in love and awe obeying her as a child and
striving to understand her lessons.</p>
<p>So this went on for years, till at last one day Bianca, full
of strange suspicions, which had become well nigh certainties,
went to Virgilio and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me in truth who is this being whom thou didst send
us as my father, for that he is not the Di Tribaldo of earlier
days, I am sure.&nbsp; Good and kind he hath been, but too
strange to be human; wild hart is he, not to be measured as a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virgil replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast guessed the riddle, and yet not all; for he
is a spirit of the elements, and his appointed time is drawing
near to an end, and, being neither good nor evil, he would have
passed away in peace into the nothing which is the end of all his
kind.&nbsp; But thou hast awakened in him a knowledge of love and
duty, so that he will die in sorrow, for he has learned from thee
what he has lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bianca asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he not be saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Virgil replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone would give his or her life, then by virtue of
that sacrifice, when the thousand years of his existence shall be
at an end, the two lives shall be as one in the world where all
are one in love for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bianca replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which I have begun I will finish.&nbsp; Having
opened the bud, I will not leave the flower; having the flower, I
will bring it to fruit and seed; the egg which I found and saved,
I will hatch.&nbsp; She who hath said &lsquo;A&rsquo; must also
say &lsquo;B,&rsquo; till all the letters are learned.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who such a course hath once
begun,<br />
To the very end must run.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so will I give my life to give a soul to this poor spirit,
even as the Lord gave His to save mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Then
Bianca departed, and many days passed.&nbsp; On a time Virgilio
saw Bals&agrave;bo, who greeted him with a sad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sand is well-nigh run out, oh master,&rdquo; said
the spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet another day, and the sun which is to
rise no more will go down behind the mountain-range of
life.&nbsp; <i>Il sole tramonta</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And art thou pleased to have been for a time a
man?&rdquo; asked Virgil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not an ill thing to be loved by the
children,&rdquo; replied Bals&agrave;bo.&nbsp; &ldquo;There I had
great joy and learned much&mdash;yea, far too much for my own
happiness, for I found that I was lost.&nbsp; When I was
ignorant, and only a poor child of air and earth, fire and water,
I knew nothing of good or evil, or of a soul or a better life in
eternity; now I have learned all that by love, and also that it
is not for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; replied Virgilio.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
who has learned to love has made the first step to
immortality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after a few days, news was brought to Virgilio that
Bals&agrave;bo, whom men called Di Tribaldo, was dying, and that
Bianca also could not live long; and that night the master,
looking from his tower beyond the Arno on the hill, that which is
now called the San Gallo, or the Torre di Galileo, saw afar in
the night a strange vision, the forms of a man and of a young
woman, divinely beautiful, sweetly spiritual, in a golden, rosy
light, ever rising higher and higher, while afar there was a
sound as of harps and voices singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They walked in the world as in a dream,<br
/>
For nothing they saw as it now doth seem;<br />
And all they knew of care and woe<br />
Is now but a tale of the long ago;<br />
And they will walk in the land on high<br />
Where flowers are blooming ever and aye,<br />
And every flower in its breath and bloom<br />
Sings in the spirit with song perfume,<br />
And the song which it sings in the land above,<br />
In a thousand forms, is eternal love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as they rose Virgilio saw falling from them, as it were, a
rain of rose-leaves and lilies, and every leaf as it fell faded,
yet became a spirit which entered some newborn babe, and the
spirit was its life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetly hast thou sung, oh Spirit of God,&rdquo; said
Virgilio, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>as the last note was heard and the sight vanished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The poorest devil may be saved by Love.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The idea that a soul or spirit, human or other, can enter into
a dead body and revive it is to be found in the legends of all
lands, from those of ancient Egypt, as appears in that of
&ldquo;Anpu and Bata,&rdquo; which has been nine times translated
into English, down to several of these Italian tales.&nbsp; It is
a fancy which need not be traditional or borrowed; it would occur
to man as soon as the Shaman pretended to go out of his body
while in a trance.</p>
<p>After the foregoing was written out, including the allusion to
seeds found in tombs a thousand years old which grew again, and
which were, of course, Roman or Etruscan, as the only kind known
in Italy&mdash;I never having read of any such thing save as
regards corn found in Egypt&mdash;I met with the following
passage in &ldquo;The Sagacity and Morality of Plants,&rdquo; by
Dr. J. E. Taylor:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Seeds have been found in Celtic tumuli . .
. which, after an interval of perhaps two thousand years, have
germinated into plants, and similar successful experiments have
been made with seeds found in ancient Roman tombs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regards the original of this story, it was so imperfect,
brief, and trifling that I have, as it were, well-nigh
reconstructed it, and might as well claim to be its author as
not, as I should have done were I an earlier Italian novelist,
who without scruple appropriated popular stories with as little
conscience as Robert Burns did old ballads.&nbsp; Bishop Percy
amended them, and owned it, and all that he got thereby was much
abuse and ridicule.&nbsp; But it is <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of little consequence when the legend
is not offered as a mere tradition, and this is only a scrap of
tradition <i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>The character of Bals&agrave;bo belongs closely to the class
which includes Falstaff, Panurge, Punch, Belphegor, and many
other types who are &ldquo;without conscience or cognition&rdquo;
of right or wrong, neither adapted to be banned or blessed,
genially selfish, extravagantly generous, good fellows and bad
Christians, yet who have ever been pre-eminently popular.&nbsp;
But I am not aware that it ever entered into a mortal head to
dream of their being reformed, any more than their cousins
Manfred and Don Giovanni, for which reason I consider this tale
of Bals&agrave;bo as decidedly original.&nbsp; Sinners we have
had repentant by thousands, but this is really the only history
of the conversion of Nothingarian.</p>
<p>Paracelsus was the first writer, following the Neo-Platonists
and popular traditions, to make a mythology of elementary spirits
and define their nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There dwell,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;under the earth
semi-homines, or half-human beings, who have all temporal things
which can be enjoyed and desired.&nbsp; They are called
&lsquo;gnomes,&rsquo; though properly the name should be sylphs
or pygmies.&nbsp; They are not spirits, yet may be compared to
them . . . between them and the devil is a great difference,
because he does not die and they do, albeit they are very
long-lived.&nbsp; And they are not <i>spirits</i>, because a
spirit is immortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gave birth in later days to the
&ldquo;Entertainments&rdquo; of the Comte de Gabalis, and the
exquisite &ldquo;Undine&rdquo; of La Motte Fouqu&eacute;.&nbsp;
Of late years exact science, by its investigations into zoology
and botany, <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>has approached Paracelsus by discovering incredible
developments in <i>instinctive</i> intelligence, as distinguished
from self-conscious reason, in all that exists.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Since the foregoing tale, with the comment on it, was written,
even to the last word, I met with and read a novel entitled
&ldquo;Entombed in the Flesh,&rdquo; by Michael Henry Dziewicki,
<a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> which, both as regards plot and many
details, bears such an extraordinary, and yet absolutely
accidental, resemblance to the story of
&ldquo;Bals&agrave;bo&rdquo; that, unless I enter a protest to
the contrary, I can hardly escape the accusation of having
borrowed largely from it.&nbsp; In it a demon, neither angel nor
devil, enters into the body of a man just dead, and has many
marvellous and amusing adventures, being, of course, involved in
the fate of a girl whom Lucifer wishes to destroy.&nbsp; The end
is, however, very different, because in the novel Phantasto, the
spirit, is set free, and the maiden rescued by the latter going
into a Salvation Army meeting and being moved by hearing the name
and teaching of Jesus.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Bals&agrave;bo&rdquo; the
demon has immortality conferred on him by Bianca&rsquo;s giving
her own <i>life</i> to effect it.&nbsp; This is, I think, more
ingenious than any other sacrifice could be, because in the tale,
though it be rudely expressed, there is the exquisite conception
that an immortal existence can take in, include with it, and
identify a minor intelligence or raise it to a higher sphere.</p>
<p>That I have somewhat enlarged the original tale or written it
up will be evident to everyone, but I have omitted very little
which is in the text, save an incantation <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>at the end
which Virgil addresses to the unborn souls who are to enter into
the bodies of the children born of the rose-leaves.&nbsp; But I
have inadvertently missed one point, to the effect that, after
having been kicked out of hell, Bals&agrave;bo got down so low in
morality as to be finally expelled from the Vatican.&nbsp; The
literal translation of the passage is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But poor Bals&agrave;bo, who had been kicked out of the
kitchen of hell, . . . and even from the Vatican (felt honoured)
. . . when Bianca scolded him like a child, and said:
&lsquo;<i>Vergogna</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;For
shame!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VIRGIL, MINUZZOLO, AND THE SIREN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caperat hic cantus <i>Minyas</i> mulcere,
nec ullus<br />
Pr&aelig;teriturus erat Sirenum tristia fata<br />
Iam manibus remi exciderant stetit uncta carina.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Orpheus</span>:
<i>Argonauticis</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Virgil had a pupil named Minuzzolo, who was very small
indeed, but a very beautiful youth, and the great master was very
fond of his disciple.]</p>
<p>They undertook a long journey round the world, since Virgil
wished that his little Minuzzolo should learn all the wonders
which are hidden in the earth.</p>
<p>So he said to him one day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, Minuzzolo, that we are going on a long journey
which may last for years, and thou must be right brave, my boy,
for many are the perils through which we must pass, and dire are
the monsters which we shall meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went forth into the world, far and wide, and little
Minuzzolo showed himself as brave as the biggest, and as eager to
learn as a whole school with a holiday before it when it shall
have got its lesson.</p>
<p>All things he learned: how to resist all sorceries and evil
spells; he could call the eagle down from the sky, and the fish
from the sea; but one thing he did not learn from his master.</p>
<p>One day Virgil gave him a book wherein was the charm <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>against the
Song of the Siren, the words which protect him who knows them
against the music of the Voice.&nbsp; But two leaves stuck
together like one, so that Minuzzolo skipped two pages, and never
knew it.</p>
<p>Virgil had gone forth, and Minuzzolo, seated in a hut in the
forest where they lived, began to sing.&nbsp; Then he heard in
the wood a girl&rsquo;s voice, which seemed to come from a
torrent, singing in answer; and it was so sweet that all his soul
and senses were captured, he forgot all duty and desire, his
master and everything, all in a mad yearning to follow the
sound.&nbsp; So he went on and on, led by the song; day and night
were unnoticed by him.&nbsp; The Voice went with the torrent, he
followed it to a river, and the river to the sea, where the waves
rolled high in foam and fog; he followed the song, it went deep
into the sea, but he gave no heed, but went ever on.</p>
<p>Then he found himself in a very beautiful but extremely
strange old city&mdash;a city like a dream of an ancient
age.&nbsp; And as eve came on, the youth asked of this and that
person where he could pass the night, and all said that they knew
of no place, for into that city no strangers ever came.&nbsp;
However, at last one said to him: &ldquo;I know where there
dwells a witch, and she often hath strange guests; perhaps she
will give thee shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to her,&rdquo; replied Minuzzolo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
but jest, and I would be sorry if so fair a youth should be
devoured by some monster.&rdquo; <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Little fear of that have I,&rdquo; replied the young
magician.&nbsp; &ldquo;He who has harmed no one need fear none,
and in the name of my Master I am safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went to the house and knocked, and there came to his
call an old woman of such unearthly ugliness, that Minuzzolo saw
at once that she was a sorceress.&nbsp; So when she asked what he
wanted, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the name of him whom all<br />
Like thee obey, and heed his call,<br />
And tremble at his lightest word,<br />
<span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, my master and thy lord,<br />
I bid thee give me food and rest,<br />
Whate&rsquo;er thou canst and of the best!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>And she
answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whate&rsquo;er is asked in that dread
name,<br />
I&rsquo;m sworn to answer to the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the youth stayed there and was well served.&nbsp; And in
the morning he thanked the old woman, and asked her where he
could find Virgil.&nbsp; She replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not seek him in the forest where thou didst leave
him.&nbsp; Since then thou hast passed over half the world, for
she who called thee was a Siren, whom none can resist unless they
learn the spell which thy master, foreseeing that thou wert in
danger, gave thee, and which thou didst not learn.&nbsp; However,
I will give thee a ring which will be of use, but do not seek its
help until thou shalt be in dire need.&nbsp; And then thou shalt
say to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In nome del gran Mago,<br />
In nome di Virgilio,<br />
A chi sara buono!<br />
Questo anello sara mia sposa!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the great magician!<br />
In the name of Virgil!<br />
To whom be all good,<br />
This ring shall be my spouse!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well shall I remember it,&rdquo; replied
Minuzzolo.&nbsp; So he went on to the land and by the strand ever
on, till he came to a great and fine ship, and pausing as he
looked at it, he thought he would like to be a sailor.&nbsp;
Therefore he asked the captain if a boy was wanted.&nbsp; And the
captain, being much pleased, took him and treated him very
kindly, and for three years Minuzzolo was a mariner.</p>
<p>But one night there was a great storm, and there came in an
instant such a tremendous wave and gale of wind that Minuzzolo
was blown afar into the sea and wafted away a mile ere he was
missed.&nbsp; However, he gained a beach and scrambled ashore,
where he lay for a long time as if asleep.&nbsp; Yet it seemed to
him, while thinking of the captain and his mates, that he were
being borne away and ever on, as if in a dream, and indeed, when
he awoke, he found himself in what he knew must be another
country, in another clime.</p>
<p>And being very hungry, and seeing a fine garden wherein
delicious fruit was growing, he approached a tree to pluck a
pear; when all at once there sprang out a man of terrible <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>form, with
eyes like a dragon, who threatened him with death.</p>
<p>But Minuzzolo drew the ring from his pocket and repeated the
charm, and as he did this the sorcerer fell dead.&nbsp; And then
he heard the voice of the Siren singing afar, and it drew nearer
and nearer, till a beautiful girl appeared.&nbsp; And when she
saw the hideous sorcerer lying dead, she exclaimed with joy:
&ldquo;At last I am free!&nbsp; This the great Master Virgilio
has done; over land and sea and afar off he has put forth his
power.&nbsp; Blessed be his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she explained to the youth that she and others had been
enslaved and enchanted, and compelled to become a Siren and
bewitch men.&nbsp; But Virgilio, knowing that she was lurking
near to charm his pupil, had given him the book to read, but that
her master by his power had closed the leaves, so that Minuzzolo
had yielded to her song.&nbsp; But Virgilio had put forth a
greater power, and brought it to pass that the Siren was herself
enchanted with love, and in the end the sorcerer was
defeated.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio appeared and blessed the young couple, who were
wedded and lived ever after happily.&nbsp; Such things did
Virgilio.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This strange story, in which classic traditions are blended
with the common form of a fairy-tale, was sent to me from Siena,
where it had been taken down from some authority to me
unknown.&nbsp; It begins very abruptly, for which reason I have
supplied the introductory passage in parenthesis.</p>
<p>Minuzzolo, led strangely afar over the sea, drawn by the voice
of the Siren, suggests that the Argonauts were called
<i>Minii</i>, because they were descended, like Jason, from the
daughters of <i>Minia</i>.&nbsp; There may be here some confusion
with Minos, of whom Virgil says that &ldquo;he holds in his hand
an urn and shakes the destiny of all human beings, citing them to
appear before his tribunal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Qu&aelig;sitor Minos
urnam movet.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the Italian legend Minuzzolo, or
Minos, has a ring which compels all who hear his charm to
obey.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Minuzzolo wins his Siren by means of a ring, and it is
remarkable that Hesychius derives the name <i>Siren</i> from
<i>&sigma;&epsilon;&#7984;&rho;&eta;</i>, <i>seire</i>, a small
ring.&nbsp; Moreover, the sirens in the old Greek mythology did
not of their own accord or will entice sailors to death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The oracle,&rdquo; says Pozzoli (Dizionario Mit.)
&ldquo;had predicted that they should perish whenever a single
mortal who had heard their enchanting voices should escape
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore they were compelled by a superior
power to act as they did.</p>
<p>Confused and garbled as it all is, it seems almost certain
that in this tale there are relics of old Gr&aelig;co-Latin
mythology.</p>
<p>The names of the three Sirens were Aglaope, Pisinoe,
Thexiopia; according to Cherilus, Thelxiope, Molpe and
Aglaophonos.&nbsp; <i>Clearchus</i>, however, gives one as
Leucosia, another as Ligea, the third as Parthenope.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aglaope was sweetest to behold, Aglaophone had the most
enchanting voice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore we may infer that
Aglaope, or Aglaophone, was the heroine of this tale.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that <i>Aglaia</i>, a daughter of Jupiter, was the
fairest and first of the three Muses, as Aglaope was of the
Sirens.</p>
<p>It would seem evident that Edgar A. Poe had the Siren Ligea in
mind when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ligeia, Ligeia,<br />
My beautiful one,<br />
Whose harshest idea<br />
Will to melody run . . . <br />
Ligeia! wherever<br />
Thy image may be,<br />
No magic shall sever<br />
Thy music from thee;<br />
Thou hast bound many eyes<br />
In a dreamy sleep,<br />
But the strains still arise<br />
Which thy vigilance keep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Most
remarkable of all is the fact that the Sirens, who were regarded
as evil witches or enchantresses of old, are in this story, which
was written by a witch, indicated as women compelled by fate to
delude mariners, which has escaped all commentators, and yet was
plainly enough declared by the Oracle.</p>
<h2>LAVERNA.</h2>
<blockquote><p>One day a fox entered a sculptor&rsquo;s shop,<br
/>
And found a marble head, when thus he spoke:<br />
&lsquo;O Head! there is such feeling shown in thee<br />
By art&mdash;and yet thou canst not feel at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>&AElig;sop&rsquo;s
Fables</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happened on a time that Virgil, who knew all things hidden
or magical, he being a magician and poet, having heard an
oration, was asked what he thought of it.</p>
<p>And he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems impossible for me to tell whether it is all
introduction or conclusion.&nbsp; It is like certain fish, of
whom one is in doubt whether they are all head or all tail, or
the goddess Laverna, of whom no one ever knew whether she was all
head or all body, or both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Emperor asked him who this deity might be, for he had
never heard of her.</p>
<p>And Virgil answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the gods or spirits who were of the ancient times
there was one female, who was the craftiest and most knavish of
all.&nbsp; She was called Laverna; she was a thief, and very
little known to the other deities, who were honest and dignified,
while Laverna was rarely in heaven or in the country of the
fairies.&nbsp; She was almost always on earth among thieves,
pickpockets, and panders; (she lived) in darkness.&nbsp; Once it
happened that she went to a great priest, in the form of a very
beautiful, stately priestess, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sell me your estate.&nbsp; I wish to raise on it
a temple to <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>(our) god.&nbsp; I swear to you on my body that I will
pay thee within a year.&rsquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore the priest gave her the estate.&nbsp; And
very soon Laverna had sold off all the crops, grain, cattle, and
poultry.&nbsp; There was not left the value of four
farthings.&nbsp; But on the day fixed for payment there was no
Laverna to be seen.&nbsp; The fair goddess was far away, and had
left her creditor in the lurch&mdash;<i>in asso</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time Laverna went to a great lord, and
bought of him a castle, well-furnished, with much land.&nbsp; But
this time she swore <i>on her head</i> to pay in full in six
months.&nbsp; And she did as she had done by the priest; she
stole and sold everything&mdash;furniture, cattle, crops; there
was not left wherewith to feed a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the priest and the lord appealed to the gods,
complaining that they had been robbed by a goddess.&nbsp; And it
was soon found that the thief was Laverna.&nbsp; Therefore she
was called to judgment before all the gods.&nbsp; And she was
asked what she had done with the property of the priest, unto
whom she had sworn by her body to make payment at the time
appointed.&nbsp; And she replied by a strange deed, which amazed
them all, for she made her body disappear, so that only her head
remained, and it cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Behold me!&nbsp; I swore by my body, but body
have I none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all the gods laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the priest came the lord, who had also been
tricked, and to whom she had sworn by her head.&nbsp; And in
reply to him Laverna showed to all present her whole body, and it
was one of the greatest beauty, but without a head, and from the
neck there came a voice which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Behold me, for I am Laverna, who<br
/>
Have come to answer to that lord&rsquo;s complaint<br />
Who swears that I contracted debt with him,<br />
And have not paid, although the time is o&rsquo;er,<br />
And that I am a thief because I swore<br />
Upon my head; but, as you all can see,<br />
I have no head at all, and therefore I<br />
Assuredly ne&rsquo;er swore by such an oath!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was indeed a storm of laughter among the
gods, who made the matter right by ordering the head to <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>join the
body, and bidding Laverna pay up her dues, which she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jove spoke and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here is a roguish deity without a duty, while
there are in Rome innumerable thieves, sharpers, cheats, and
rascals&mdash;<i>ladri</i>, <i>bindolini</i>, <i>truffatori e
scrocconi</i>&mdash;who live by deceit.&nbsp; These good folk
have neither a church nor a god, and it is a great pity, for even
the very devils have their master Satan.&nbsp; Therefore I
command that in future Laverna shall be the goddess of all the
knaves or dishonest tradesmen, and all the rubbish and refuse of
the human race, who have been hitherto without a god or devil,
inasmuch as they have been too despicable for the one or the
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Laverna became the goddess of all dishonest
people.&nbsp; Whenever anyone planned or intended any knavery or
aught wicked, he entered her temple and invoked Laverna, who
appeared to him as a woman&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; But if he did his
work badly and maladroitly, when he again invoked her he saw only
the body.&nbsp; But if he was clever, then he beheld the whole
goddess, head and body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laverna was not more chaste than she was honest, and
had many lovers and many children.&nbsp; It is said that, not
being bad at heart, she often repented her life and sins; but do
what she might she could not reform, because her passions were so
inveterate.&nbsp; And if a man had got any woman with child, or
any maid found herself <i>incinta</i>, and would hide it from the
world and escape scandal, they would go every day to invoke
Laverna. <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; Then, when the time came for the
suppliant to be delivered, Laverna would bear her in sleep during
the night to her temple, and after the birth cast her into
slumber again, and carry her back to her bed.&nbsp; And when she
awoke in the morning she was ever in vigorous health and felt no
weariness, and all seemed to her as a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to those who desired in time to reclaim their
children Laverna was indulgent, if they led such lives as pleased
her and faithfully worshipped her.&nbsp; And this is the manner
of the ceremony and the incantation to be offered to Laverna
every night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a set place devoted to the goddess, be it
a room, a cellar, or a grove, ever a solitary place.&nbsp; Then
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>take a
small table of the size of forty playing-cards set close
together, and this must be hid in the same place, and going there
at night. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the forty cards and spread them on the table,
making of them, as it were, a close carpet on it.&nbsp; Take of
the herbs <i>paura</i> <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a> and
<i>concordia</i> and boil the two together, repeating
meanwhile:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fo bollire la mano della
concordia,<br />
Per tenere a me concorde.<br />
La Laverna, che possa portare a me<br />
Il mio figlio e che possa<br />
Guardarmelo da qual un pericolo!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bollo questa erba ma non bollo l&rsquo;erba.<br
/>
Bollo la <i>paura</i> <a name="citation41b"></a><a
href="#footnote41b" class="citation">[41b]</a> che possa tenere
lontano<br />
Qualunque persona, e se le viene,<br />
L&rsquo;idea a qualchuno di avvicinarsi,<br />
Possa essere preso da paura,<br />
E fuggire lontano!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boil the cluster of <i>concordia</i><br />
To keep in concord and at peace with me<br />
Laverna, that she may restore to me<br />
My child, and that she, by her favouring care,<br />
May guard me well from danger all my life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boil this herb, yet &rsquo;tis not it which boils;<br
/>
I boil the <i>fear</i> that it may keep afar<br />
Any intruder, and if such should come<br />
[To spy upon my rite], may he be struck<br />
With fear, and in his terror haste away!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having said this, put the boiled herbs in a bottle, and
spread the cards on the table, one by one, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Batezzo queste quarante carte<br />
Ma non batezzo le quarante carte.<br />
Batezzo quaranta dei superiori<br />
Alla dea Laverna che le sue<br />
Persone divengono un vulcano<br />
Fino che la Laverna non sara<br />
Venuta da me colla mia creatura.<br />
E questi dei dal naso dalla bocca,<br />
E dall&rsquo; orecchie possino buttare<br />
Fiammi di fuoco e cenere,<br />
E lasciare pace e bene alia dea<br />
Laverna, che possa anche essa<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Abbracciare i suoi figli,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sua volunta!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;I spread before me now the forty cards,<br />
Yet &rsquo;tis not forty cards which here I spread,<br />
But forty of the gods superior<br />
To the deity Laverna, that their forms<br />
May each and all become volcanoes hot,<br />
Until Laverna comes and brings my child.<br />
And till &rsquo;tis done, may they all cast<br />
Hot flames of fire and coals from their lungs,<br />
And leave her in all peace and happiness,<br />
And still embrace her children at her will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The character of Virgil is here clearly enough only an
introduction by the narrator, in order to make a Virgilian tale
or narrative.&nbsp; But the incantation, which I believe to be
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> and ancient, is very curious and full of
tradition.&nbsp; The daring to conjure the forty gods that they
may suffer till they compel Laverna to yield is a very bold and
original conception, but something like it is found very often in
Italian witchcraft.&nbsp; It is of classic origin.&nbsp; In the
witchcraft manufactured by the Church, which only dates from the
last decade of the fifteenth century, it never occurs.&nbsp; The
witches of Sprenger and Co. never lay any of the Trinity under a
ban of torture till a desire is accomplished, nor are they ever
even invoked.</p>
<p><i>La femme comme il faut</i>, or &ldquo;the only good
woman,&rdquo; is a very ungallant misogamic corner tavern sign
once common in France.&nbsp; It represents a headless
woman.&nbsp; Perhaps she was derived from some story like this of
Laverna.&nbsp; It recalls the inhuman saying: &ldquo;The only
good (Red) Indian is a dead Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laverna is in this tale another form of Diana.&nbsp; There are
also traces of Lucina in the character.</p>

<p>There was once in Rome an ugly young lady; yes, the ugliest on
earth!&nbsp; And, as if this were not enough, she was
ill-tempered and spiteful, and in his whole course the sun did
not shine on a more treacherous being.&nbsp; She was a true
devilkin, being as small as a dwarf.&nbsp; However, devil or not,
she was worth millions, and had the luck to be betrothed to the
handsomest young man in Rome, who was, indeed, poor.</p>
<p>One day a certain Countess said to Virgil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand how it comes to pass that such a
splendid fellow is allied to such a horrid little
fright&mdash;<i>un tal spauracchio</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virgil said nothing, but he went home and took two scorpions,
and by his magic art turned them into gold, and of these he made
two ear-rings and sent them to the Countess, who was delighted
with them, and when Virgil asked her if she liked them, answered:
&ldquo;<i>Tanta</i>, <i>tanta</i>, <i>sono molto
belli</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Very much, they are so
beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said to me a little while ago,&rdquo; replied
Virgil, &ldquo;that you did not see what the handsomest man in
Rome finds to admire in the ugliest girl.&nbsp; It is gold,
Signora Contessa, which does it all&mdash;gold which makes
scorpions so charming that you wear them in your ears, and call
them beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess laughed, and said: &ldquo;Thou speakest
truth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gold like the sun turns darkness to
night,<br />
And fear or hatred to love and delight.<br />
Gold makes raptures out of alarms,<br />

<p>&ldquo;But it is really hardly worth a crown,&rdquo; replied
the merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it is worth all the rest put together,&rdquo;
answered Virgil; &ldquo;for it increases marvellously the
intellect or understanding, and thereby one can win with it the
love of whom he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;I will buy
it, and find by experience whether it can increase wit whereby we
gain hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and finding that the stone had the virtue which
Virgil ascribed to it, said to the sage one day:</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;How was it that thou didst find out and
understand the value of that gem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it, because I saw that there was in the stone a
very small fly (<i>moschettina</i>&mdash;gnat), and I knew that
flies are very quick and gay, and have great cleverness, as
anyone can see if he tries to catch them, and they make love all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly thou art a devil, oh Virgil,&rdquo; replied the
Emperor; &ldquo;and for reward I hereby make thee Emperor or Pope
over all the flies.&nbsp; There are, by the way, far too many of
them, and a perfect plague&mdash;they spoil all the meat in the
shops.&nbsp; I would that thou couldst banish all thy subjects
from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; answered Virgil.</p>
<p>Then, by his magic, he summoned the Great Fly&mdash;Il
Moscone, the King of all the Flies&mdash;and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy subjects are far too many, and a sore plague to all
mankind.&nbsp; I desire that thou wilt drive them all out of
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; replied the Moscone, &ldquo;if
thou wilt make a fly of gold as large as a great frog, and put it
in my honour in the Church of Saint Peter.&nbsp; After which,
there will no more flies be seen in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Virgil went to the Emperor and told him what Il Moscone
had said, and the Emperor commanded that the fly should be made
of many pounds of gold, and it was placed in the Church of Saint
Peter, and so long as it remained there no fly was ever seen
within the walls of Rome.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have another version of what is partially the same story,
but with a curious addition, which is of greater antiquity and
most unconsciously really Virgilian, or the old tale of the
bull&rsquo;s hide.</p>
<h2>THE FLIES IN ROME.</h2>
<p>It happened one summer in Rome that people were sadly
afflicted with flies.&nbsp; Nothing like it had ever been seen;
they swarmed by millions everywhere, they blackened the walls,
the meat on the butchers&rsquo; stands was hidden under masses of
them.&nbsp; And the poor suffered in their <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>children,
many of whom died, while all kinds of food was poisoned and
corrupted everywhere.&nbsp; Then the Emperor said to Virgil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, if thou hast indeed the art of conjuring, now is
the time to show it, by conjuring away this curse, for I verily
believe that all the flies of Egypt are come here to
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virgil replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou wilt give me so much land as I can enclose in
an ox&rsquo;s hide, I will drive all the flies away from
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor was well pleased to get so much for so small a
price, as it seemed to him, and promised that he should truly
have as much land as could be enclosed or covered <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a> in the skin of an ox.</p>
<p>Virgil summoned Il Moscone, the King of the Flies, and said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that all flies in Rome leave the city this very
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Il Moscone, the King of the Flies, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause me to become by magic a great fly of gold, and
then put me in the Church of Saint Peter, and after that there
will be no more insects in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Virgil conjured him into the form of a fly of gold, and
it was placed in the church, and at that instant all the flies
left Rome.&nbsp; At which the Emperor was well pleased.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor asked Virgil where the land lay which was to
be taken in the ox-hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to-morrow and you shall see,&rdquo; answered the
sage.</p>
<p>So the Emperor came with all his Court, and found Virgil
mounted on horseback, bearing a great bundle of leather cord,
like shoe-strings, and this had been made from the skin of the
ox.&nbsp; And beginning at one gate and letting fall the cord, he
rode around the city until all Rome was surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will observe,&rdquo; said Virgil,
&ldquo;that I have taken exactly as much land as could be
enclosed in an ox&rsquo;s hide, and as Rome stands on the ground,
therefore all Rome is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what wilt thou take for this bit of
earth&mdash;houses, people and all?&rdquo; inquired the
Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask what to me is its full value, oh my Emperor, for
I have long loved your beautiful niece!&nbsp; Give her to me <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>with one
hundred thousand crowns in gold, and I will restore to you your
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor was well pleased to grant this, and so it came to
pass that all Rome was bought and sold in one day for a purse and
a princess, or for a woman and one hundred thousand crowns.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It will be observed by many readers that in the first tale
here narrated there are combined two of the older Virgilian
legends, one being that of the Gem which has within it a
mysterious power, and which is thus told in &ldquo;The Wonderful
History of Virgil the Sorcerer.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Soon after, the Emperor having his
crown-jewels laid out before him, sent for Virgilius, and said:
&lsquo;Master, you know many things, and few are hid from your
ken.&nbsp; Tell me now, if you be indeed a judge of gems, which
think you is the best of these?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Emperor having
pointed out one gem of peculiar brilliancy, Virgilius laid it,
first in the palm of his hand, then to his ear, and said:
&lsquo;Sire, in this stone there is a worm.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Forthwith the Emperor caused the stone to be sawn asunder, and
lo, in the centre was found a worm concealed!&nbsp; Amazed at the
sagacity of Virgilius, the Emperor, at the charge of the country,
raised his allowance to a whole loaf per diem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of the fly is told in almost all the
collections.&nbsp; The reader will bear in mind the following
frank and full admission, of which all critics are invited to
make the worst, that in many cases I had already narrated these
Virgilian tales to my collector, as I did here&mdash;a course
which it is simply impossible to avoid where one is collecting in
a speciality.&nbsp; If you want fairy-tales, take whatever the
gods may send, but if you require nothing but legends of Red Cap,
you must specify, and show samples of the wares demanded.&nbsp;
But it may here be observed, that after I had communicated <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>these tales,
they all returned to me with important changes.&nbsp; In the
older legends the fly made by Virgil is manifestly&mdash;like the
leech which he also fabricated&mdash;simply an <i>amulet</i> or
talisman formed under the influence of the planets, or by
astrology.&nbsp; In the version which I give there is an
altogether different, far more ancient and mysterious motive
power described.&nbsp; This is the direct aid of <i>Moscone</i>,
the King of the Flies, suggestive of <i>Baal tse Bul</i>, or
Beelzebub himself.&nbsp; The reader may find a chapter on this
mystical being, who is also the god of news, in the
&ldquo;Legends of Florence,&rdquo; Part II.&nbsp; According to my
story, the Golden Fly is not a <i>talisman</i> made by planetary
influences, but a tribute of respect to a demon, which he demands
shall be set up in Saint Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here the
<i>witch</i>, ever inimical to orthodox faith, appears in black
and white&mdash;so true is it, as I have before remarked, that
even where my assistant has been asked to re-tell a tale, it
always returned with darker and stranger colouring, which gave it
an interest far greater than existed in the simple
narrative.&nbsp; The tale of the fly, as a mere amulet, is of
almost no importance whatever, beyond its being an insignificant
variant; but as a legend of the chief of the flies, or Beelzebub,
claiming honour and a place in the great Christian Church, it is
of extraordinary novelty.</p>
<p>Amber, in which insects are often found, especially small
flies or midges, was anciently regarded as a gem, and is classed
as one in the <i>Tesoro delle Goie</i>.&nbsp; <i>Trattato
curioso</i>, Venice, 1676.</p>
<p>It may be observed that something like this story of the gem
with an insect in it occurs not only in the early legends of
Virgil, but also in the oldest <i>novelle</i>, as <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>may be seen
in Roscoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Italian Novelists.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact,
there is probably not one of the old Neapolitan Virgilian stories
which is not, like this, of Oriental origin.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The reader who is familiar with &ldquo;The Legends of
Florence&rdquo; will remember that, in the second series of that
work, <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a> there are several tales referring to
the Red Pillars of the Baptistery, of which, as Murray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Guide Book&rdquo; states, &ldquo;at each side of the
eastern entrance of the Battisterio di San Giovanni there is a
shaft of red porphyry, presented by the Pisans in
1117.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other accounts state that the Florentines
attached immense value to these columns, and that once when there
was to be a grand division of plunder between Florence and Pisa,
the people of the former city preferred to take them, instead of
a large sum of money, or something which was apparently far more
valuable.&nbsp; And the Pisans parted from them most unwillingly,
and to deprive them of value passed them through a fire.&nbsp;
Which is all unintelligible nonsense, but which becomes clear
when we read further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had spoken of this to Mr. W. de Morgan, the
distinguished scholar, artist, and discoverer in ceramics, when
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>he
informed me that he had found, in the &lsquo;Cronaca
Pisana&rsquo; of Gardo, a passage which clearly explains the
whole.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1016, the Pisans brought the gates of wood
which are in the Duomo, and a small column, which is in the
fa&ccedil;ade, or above the gate of the Duomo.&nbsp; There are
also at the chief entrance two columns, about two fathoms each in
length, of a reddish colour, and it is said that whoever sees
them is sure in that day not to be betrayed.&nbsp; And these two
columns which were so beautiful had been so enchanted by the
Saracens, <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> that when a theft had been committed
the face of the thief could be seen reflected in them.&nbsp; And
when they had scorched them they sent them to Florence, after
which time the pillars lost their power; whence came the saying,
<i>Fiorentini ciechi</i>, or &lsquo;blind Florentines.&rsquo; <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Unto which was added, <i>Pisani traditori</i>, or
&lsquo;treacherous Pisans.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those pillars were, in
fact, magic mirrors which had acquired their power by certain
ceremonies performed when they were first polished, and which
were lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A German writer on witchcraft, Peter Goldschmidt, states that
there was once in olden time in Constantinople a certain Peter
Corsa, who, by looking in two polished stones or magic mirrors,
beheld in them proof that his wife, then far away, was unfaithful
to him.&nbsp; It is possible, or probable, that this refers to
the same pillars, before they had been brought to Pisa, even as
the column of the Medicis in the Piazza Annunciata was sent from
the East to Florence.</p>
<p>What renders this the more probable is the following <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>passage by
Comparetti, given in his &ldquo;Virgilio nel Medio
Evo&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In a History of the Pisans, written in
French in the fifteenth century and existing in manuscript in
Berne, there is mention of two columns made by Virgil, and which
were then in the cathedral of Pisa, on the tops of which one
could see the likeness of anyone who had stolen or
fornicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; See De Sinner, &ldquo;Catal. Codicum
MSS. Bibl. Bernensis,&rdquo; II., p. 129; Du Meril,
&ldquo;M&eacute;langes,&rdquo; p. 472.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is most unlikely that the Pisans had <i>two</i> pairs of
columns, in each of which appeared the forms or phantoms or
<i>simulacra</i>, of criminals, for which reason we may conclude
that those in the Battisterio of Florence are quite the same as
those which were said to have been made by Virgil.&nbsp; And it
is also probable that the belief that they were made by Virgil
went far to give them the great value which was attached to
them.&nbsp; They should be called the columns of Virgil.</p>
<p>It may be observed that the Berne manuscript cited mentions
that it was on the <i>top</i> of the pillars that the visions
were seen, and that the tops of the columns of the Battisterio
have been knocked away, possibly by the Pisans, in order to
deprive them of their peculiar value.</p>
<p>Virgil is also accredited with having made a statue which,
like Mahomet&rsquo;s coffin, hung free in mid-air, and was
visible from every part of Rome, or in fact from every door and
window.&nbsp; And it had the property that no woman who had once
beheld it had, after that, any desire to behave improperly, which
thing, according to the plainly-speaking author of &ldquo;Les
Faicts Merveilleux de Virgille,&rdquo; was a sad affliction to
the Roman dames, <i>qui aymoyent par amour</i>, since they could
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>not put
foot out of doors without seeing &ldquo;that nasty-image&rdquo;
which prevented them from having <i>soulas de leurs
amours</i>.&nbsp; So they all complained bitterly to
Virgil&rsquo;s wife, who promised to aid them.&nbsp; Therefore,
one day when her husband was absent, she went up the bridge or
ladder which led to the statue and threw down the latter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So, from that time forth, the <i>dames de Rome firent
&agrave; leur volont&eacute; et a leur plaisance</i>, <i>et
furent bien ayses de lymage qui fut abbatu</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Truly the Ibsenite and other novelists of the present day, but
especially the lady realists of our time, have great cause to be
thankful that no such statues are stuck up in the public places
of our cities, for if such were the case their occupation would
be gone for ever&mdash;or until they had overturned them.</p>
<p>Virgil would appear, however, to have been somewhat
inconsistent in this matter of statues, or else desirous of
demonstrating to the world that he could go to opposite extremes,
since he made another, which is thus delicately hinted at in a
footnote by Comparetti: <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In contradizione con questo racconto in cui
Virgilio apparisce come protettore del buon costume, trovasi un
altro racconto, secondo il quale . . . egli avrebbe fatto una

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
passage in Enenkel referred to is given with the rest of the
&ldquo;Weltbuch&rdquo; by Comparetti, and is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Virgilius der selbe man,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Bonifacius, in his &ldquo;Ludicra,&rdquo; Ravisius Textor
(&ldquo;Officina&rdquo;), and Kornmann (&ldquo;Curiosa&rdquo;)
have brought together all the instances in special chapters of
men who have fallen in love with statues.&nbsp; I observe that in
a late popular novel this device of the <i>donna artificiale</i>
is described in a manner which leaves actually nothing to be
desired to the lovers of indecency, vileness, blasphemy, or
&ldquo;realism&rdquo;&mdash;<i>c&rsquo;est tout un</i>.</p>
<p>It may be observed that in another tale collected by me,
Virgil has for his Egeria a statue called P&aelig;onia, which
comes to life when he would confer with her, and which I regard,
on what is at least startling coincidence if not full proof, a
tradition of Minerva-P&aelig;onia and Esculapius.</p>
<p>The tale in question declares that the magician Virgil, who
had a marked fancy for making statues love, or turning women into
stone&mdash;ever petting or petrifying among the
petticoats&mdash;had a third favourite, a P&aelig;onia, who was
marble when not specially required <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>for other purposes than
ornament.&nbsp; These three ladies suggest the Graces:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Aglaia, Euphrosyne que Thaliaque
splendida<br />
Clara letiti&aelig; matres!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is probably by mere coincidence or chance that in
Keats&rsquo; &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo; the habitual friend and
comforter of the hero is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Peona</i>, his sweet sister; of all
those<br />
His friends, the dearest, . . .<br />
Whose eloquence did breathe away the curse.<br />
She led him like some midnight spirit-nurse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that Peona, through all the poem, plays the part which
P&aelig;onia has with Virgil is unquestionable.&nbsp; It would
seem as if there is, if not a spiritual, at least an
&aelig;sthetic influence in names.&nbsp; <i>Nomen est
omen</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;All Bobs are bobbish,&rdquo; said a
farmer, &ldquo;and all Dicks dickies.&rdquo;</p>

me?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boethius</span> <i>to</i>

<p>&ldquo;All by prayer and penitence<br />

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Ballad of Sir
Tannh&auml;user</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There once lived in Florence a young man who was not really
bad at heart, but utterly selfish, especially to his relations,
and was without heed or feeling as to the sufferings of
others.&nbsp; And, it being in his power, he wasted all the
income of the family on sport, letting his brothers and sisters
endure great privations; nor would he have cared much had they
starved.&nbsp; He was like all such people&mdash;frivolous and
capricious.&nbsp; If he met a poor child in the street, he would
give it a gold crown, and then let all at home hunger for
days.</p>
<p>One day his suffering mother went to Virgilio, and, telling <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>him all about
her son, begged the master, if it were possible, to reform
him.</p>
<p>Virgilio said to her: &ldquo;I will indeed do something which
will bring thy son to his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was named Adelone, and Virgilio, meeting him the
next day, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou wouldst fain see a strange thing
indeed&mdash;such as thou hast erewhile prayed me to show thee by
my art&mdash;then be to-night at twelve in the cloister of Santa
Maria Novella, where thou wilt see and learn that which it is
most needful for thee to know.&nbsp; But to behold and bear the
sight thou muse be bold, for a faint heart will fail before
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Adelone, who, to do him justice, was no coward, did not
fail to be in the cloister of Santa Maria Novella at the
appointed hour.&nbsp; And as the last stroke of twelve was heard,
Adelone saw before him the spirit of a young man named Geronio,
who had died one year before, and who had been, as one like him
in all respects, his most intimate friend.&nbsp; They were always
together, and what one did the other joined in; both were
reckless wasters of money, and selfishly indifferent to their
families.&nbsp; And as Adelone looked at Geronio he saw in the
face of the latter such an expression of awful suffering, that it
was a torture to behold him.&nbsp; And Geronio, seeing this,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depart now, for it is time; but this night I will come
to thee and remain with thee till morning.&rdquo; <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>And Adelone was glad to have seen Geronio once more, but
greatly grieved at finding him in such suffering.</p>
<p>That night he was in his room, which was on the ground, and at
the appointed hour the spirit came.&nbsp; And, looking with awe
at his friend, Adelone said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that thou art in pain beyond all
belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Geronio; &ldquo;I suffer the
greatest agony, such as no mortal could endure.&nbsp; But I pray
you come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two sunk softly down into the earth, ever deeper and
deeper in silent darkness, until Adelone saw that they were in an
immense cavern, all of gray ice, dimly lighted, with dripping
icicles hanging from the roof, and all the floor was covered with
dirty, half-freezing water, under <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>which was a bed of stinking mud, and
over all was an air of sadness and wretchedness beyond
description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my home,&rdquo; said Geronio; &ldquo;but it is
as nothing compared to what I suffer in my soul&mdash;which is a
thousand times more terrible than anything which mortals can
imagine, for they have no idea of what spiritual torture is like,
because they always think of pain as bodily.&nbsp; But know that
I had rather be beaten or burned in fire for a year than suffer
for an instant the remorse which I endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can anything be done to help you?&rdquo; asked
Adelone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all can be done; and you can save me and not only
give me peace, but do as much for thyself, and thereby escape
what I have suffered.&nbsp; If thou wilt lead a good and loving
life&mdash;good and kind to all, especially to thy family and
friends, no longer wasting money and life on selfish follies, no
longer neglecting duty and acting as an egoist&mdash;thus thou
canst give me peace, and rescue me from this inferno.&nbsp; But
woe unto thee, shouldst thou promise this and fail to keep thy
word.&nbsp; For when thy time cometh, as come it will, thou wilt
suffer as I do&mdash;yea, with redoubled remorse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Adelone, looking about him, saw many sad shades of men
and women wandering or wading through the icy water; all people
who had lived for themselves alone, all waiting till someone as
yet alive should, by good conduct, save them.&nbsp; And none
spoke, for they were doomed to silence.&nbsp; So they looked at
one another, and passed on, and such looks were the only thing
like comfort allowed them.</p>
<p>Then Adelone fell, as it seemed to him, asleep, and when he
awoke he was in his own room, but he well knew that it was no
dream which he had beheld.&nbsp; And from that hour he was
another man, becoming as good as he had been bad, living to make
all others happy, and devoted in every way to his family.&nbsp;
And thereby he became for the first time truly contented.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Six months passed, and one night at twelve o&rsquo;clock, on
awaking, he saw before him Geronio, who no longer seemed to
suffer as before, though there was still in his eyes something
terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it with thee?&rdquo; asked Adelone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far better.&nbsp; Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Adelone found himself in a great castle, which <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>seemed like a
free prison, which was grim and without comfort.&nbsp; Many souls
were in it, but they were walking about together, or resting and
conversing, apparently in no suffering.&nbsp; It was a joyless
place, but not one of torture, nor was it filthy. <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not suffer so much here,&rdquo; said
Geronio.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have still much remorse, but at least we
have the consolation of being able to converse one with another,
and enjoy sympathy in sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you talk about?&rdquo; asked Adelone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefly about the people whom we hope will set us
free.&nbsp; I talk of thee, because all my hope is in thee.&nbsp;
I think of nothing else by day or night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Adelone returned to his home.&nbsp; After six months he
beheld Geronio again.&nbsp; Again he found himself in a castle,
but the spirits were conversing happily, many were singing hymns,
they had guitars and mandolins, and here and there were vases of
flowers which gave forth delightful perfume.</p>
<p>Geronio said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are happier still, and, believe me, friend, if
thou canst in this life make others as good as thou art, to love
their relations and friends, and cease to be selfish, thereby
everyone can save another soul, and win great reward for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adelone replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly will do all I can to content thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day he did all that he could, not only to do good
himself, but to cause others to act like him.&nbsp; Six months
after this Geronio came to him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I know that thou art truly good, learn that I
am at peace.&nbsp; And as thou hast been the means of giving it
to others, know that in future all good spirits will aid
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not enough not to be a sinner.&nbsp; He who does not
take care and pains and labour earnestly to make others happy
will be punished as an evil-doer.&nbsp; He who does not love (us)
is an enemy.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked in this, as in all the other tales from
the same sources, when a moral end or plot is to <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>be worked
out, it is done without benefit of clergy or aid of priest, or
the Church.&nbsp; For these are legends of the witches and
wizards, who have ever been the foes, and consequently the hated
and afflicted, of the orthodox.&nbsp; It is a curious reflection
that as it has been said that the last savage in America will die
with the last Indian, so the <i>strega</i>, or witch, will remain
to the end a heathen.&nbsp; And I find curious emotion in the
thought that what I have gathered, or am gathering, with such
care, is the last remainder of antique heathenism in
Europe.&nbsp; Superstitions there are everywhere, but in this
kind Italy is alone.</p>
<h2>VIRGIL AND DORIONE, or THE MAGIC VASE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>I have a vase in which I daily throw<br />
All scraps and useless rubbish&mdash;oh that I<br />
Had one wherein to cast away all thoughts,<br />
Imaginations, dreams and memories<br />
Which haunt and vex the soul, to disappear<br />
For ever, lost in fast forgetfulness!<br />
That were a vase indeed, and worth far more<br />
Than that which forms the subject of this tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many centuries ago there was in Naples a young man named
Dorione, who studied magic, and his master was a great sorcerer
named Virgil.&nbsp; One evening Dorione found himself in company
with friends, and there was present another wizard named Belsevo.
<a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a>&nbsp; Now, there was not bread enough
in the house for supper for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; remarked Belsevo.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
who hath art will find his bread in any part.&nbsp; Observe
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a large vase, he turned it upside down and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Viene pane!<br />
Abbiamo fame;<br />
Dimmi o Cerere del pane!<br />
Se questa grazia mi farai,<br />
Sempre fedele a te sarai.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;Come, bread, to me,<br />
For hungry are we!<br />
Oh, Ceres, give us bread!<br />
Grant me this grace benign,<br />
And I will be ever thine!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he removed the vase, and there were on the table eight
small loaves.</p>
<p>Then Belsevo said to Dorione:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou not give us wine for the bread, O scholar of
the grand master Virgil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dorione, being only a beginner in magic, could not effect
such a miracle, and was much ashamed because all laughed at
him.</p>
<p>The next morning Dorione told what had happened to Virgil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well didst thou deserve,&rdquo; replied the master,
&ldquo;to be thus scoffed at and jeered, for a young magician
should never play tricks at a table like a juggler to amuse
fools.&nbsp; But thou hast been sufficiently punished, and to
please thee I will give thee a fine present.&nbsp; And if thou
canst not make bread come, thou shalt at least have the power to
make it and other things disappear.&nbsp; I will give thee this
vase of bronze.&nbsp; It is but small, as thou seest, but tell
any object, however large, to disappear in it, then the vase will
swallow it.&nbsp; Thou shalt keep for thyself in secret a house
somewhere, and whatever the vase may swallow thou wilt find it in
the house, however distant thou mayst be from it.&nbsp; Only say,
&lsquo;Go into the vase!&rsquo; and by the vase it will be
swallowed up.&nbsp; But thou shalt never use it to steal, or for
any dishonest purpose.&nbsp; So long as thou art honest it will
serve, and none shall rob thee of it.&nbsp; And if that should
come to pass, call to it and it will return to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dorione took the vase, and thanked the grand master
Virgil.&nbsp; After a time the scholar went on a long
journey.&nbsp; Dorione possessed a small castle in a remote place
in the mountains of Tuscany, and in it was a secret vault.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will send all that the
vase may swallow.&nbsp; Many a thing may be come by honestly, if
one knew how to send it away and where to put it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He who hath a cage, I&rsquo;ve
heard,<br />
In time will surely get a bird.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It came to pass that he became the secretary of a certain <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>lord, who,
like many of the brave gentry of his time, was ever at war with
somebody, plundering or being plundered, every one in his turn,
as fortune favoured.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Up on the top of the hill to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in the dale to-morrow;<br />
Oft in the morning happy and gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After a night of sorrow;<br />
For some must fall that others may rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the swallow goes chirping as she
flies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One evening his master heard a trumpet afar, and, looking
forth, seemed suddenly startled, like a man in great alarm.&nbsp;
Pointing to a splendid suit of armour, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seest thou that armour, Dorione?&nbsp; It is worth ten
thousand crowns, and I would give ten thousand it were this
instant in hell.&nbsp; I took it in a raid from the Grand Duke,
and he will be here in ten minutes with all his men.&nbsp; If he
finds the armour I shall lose my head.&nbsp; And there, too, is
an iron chest full of gold and jewels&mdash;all plunder, and all
in evidence against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give it to me,&rdquo; answered Dorione,
&ldquo;I will make it all vanish in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I give it with all my heart; but be quick about
it, for the Grand Duke and his soldiers are at the gate, and I
feel the rope round my neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dorione brought his vase in a minute, and uttered the
conjuration:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vattene via!&nbsp; Vattene via!<br />
Roba bella, cosa mia!<br />
Vai nell&rsquo; istante al mio castello!<br />
Apri la bocca, vaso bello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten away!&nbsp; Begone! begone!<br />
All ye fine things which are now mine own,<br />
Fly to my castle&mdash;never pause;<br />
Beautiful vase, now open thy jaws.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in an instant the armour and chest went flying into the
vase and disappeared.</p>
<p>Just as they vanished the Duke and his men entered, but though
they sought in every cranny they found nothing; and so, having
come for a bargain of wool, went away shorn, <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> as the proverb says.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Thou hast saved my life,&rdquo; said the
Signore.&nbsp; &ldquo;God only knows how you ran away with the
things, but you are welcome to them.&nbsp; Truly I was glad to
get them, but a thousand times better pleased to see them
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day the Signore and Dorione found themselves in a battle
together, sore beset and separated from all their troop.&nbsp;
They were in extremest danger of being killed. <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; When all at once there came an
idea to Dorione, who had his vase slung to his side like a
canteen.&nbsp; He pronounced the spell, ordering all the arms in
the hands of the enemy to fly through the vase to his
castle.&nbsp; In an instant swords and spears, daggers and
battle-axes, had left their owners, who stood unarmed and
amazed.&nbsp; So the two were saved.</p>
<p>The Signore took a great deal of booty, and rewarded Dorione
very liberally, the more so because he was greatly delighted to
see the gifts disappear in the vase&mdash;no matter what, all was
fish to that net, and all the sheep black&mdash;and Dorione liked
to please his kind master, especially in this way.&nbsp; Yes, to
amuse him he would often wish away a gold-hilted and jewelled
sword or helm from an enemy, and was pleased to hear the brave
old knight laugh to see the things fly.</p>
<p>The generosity of the lord stopped, however, at a certain
point.&nbsp; He had a beautiful daughter whom Dorione loved,
<i>alla follia</i>, to distraction, but the father would not
consent to bestow her on him.&nbsp; But it came to pass that one
day the castle was besieged by a vast force, which spared neither
man, woman nor child, and it seemed plain that the besieged must
yield.&nbsp; The lord bade Dorione to cause the arms of the enemy
to vanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; replied his secretary, &ldquo;I
cannot do it.&nbsp; The fame of my vase or of my power has spread
far and wide, and the enemy have had their arms enchanted by a
mighty sorcerer, so that I cannot take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fought on until of all the garrison only Dorione, with
the lord and his daughter, were left alive.&nbsp; They were in
extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; thought Dorione, &ldquo;something must
be done, for there is many a wolf at the door.&nbsp; Let me see
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>whether I
cannot make the young lady go into my vase, and then her
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, bringing them together, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Signora bella, signora mia!<br />
La pi&ugrave; bella che su questa terra sia!<br />
Ti prego&mdash;subito, subito,<br />
Di qua vattene via!<br />
Vai nell istante al mio castello,<br />
Vi troverai un vaso bello,<br />
Che la sua bocca aprira,<br />
E li dentro ti salvera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely lady, lady mine own,<br />
The fairest whom earth has ever known;<br />
Fly in a hurry, oh, fly away!<br />
Leave the castle&mdash;flit while you may,<br />
And off to my distant shelter flee!<br />
The beautiful vase is ready for thee,<br />
Who will open her mouth to take you in.<br />
Safe you will be when once within!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a second, ere the eye could follow, the young lady was
whirled away mysteriously, and, the conjuration being repeated,
then her father.&nbsp; After which Dorione prayed to the spirit
of the vase, who was no other than Saint Virgil himself, <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a> to save him also.&nbsp; And in an
instant he felt himself swallowed up like a bean in the mouth of
a horse.&nbsp; And as soon he found himself in the vault of the
castle with the lady and her father.&nbsp; And they were amazed,
in looking about, to see what wealth was there gathered up, for
Dorione had been very industrious in many a battle in sending
arms and booty to his home.</p>
<p>Then all three, joining hands, danced and sang for joy to find
themselves safe, Dorione and the lady doing the most rejoicing,
because the lord had promptly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this you may get married.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they
had the wedding that night.</p>
<p>The good lord, as a proof of affection and esteem for Dorione,
pronounced an oration of regret as a penance on himself for not
having sooner consented to the nuptials, ending with these words:
&ldquo;And now let everyone here present drink a cask of wine,
and get as drunk as a tile, or four fiddlers.&rdquo; <a

AND THE LADY OF ICE AND WATER. <a name="citation63"></a><a

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And truly at that time it came to pass<br
/>
That Virgil, by the power of sorcery,<br />
Made a fair lady, who did shine like glass<br />
Or diamonds with wondrous brilliancy,<br />
Whom to the Emperor he did present,<br />
And who therewith, I trow, was well content.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Virgilo il
Mago</span> (MS.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happened on a time that the Emperor, coming from Rome to
Florence, was guest in the Duke&rsquo;s palace, and treated so
magnificently and in a manner so much after his own heart, that
he was indeed well content.</p>
<p>Now, in those days there was in Florence no Signore who, when
he gave an entertainment, did not invite Virgil, not only because
he was the greatest poet in Italy, but because he always played
some admirable trick or jest, which made men merry and was always
new.</p>
<p>So at the first great feast the Emperor was greatly delighted
at the endless jokes, as well as by the genius of the
distinguished guest.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the Emperor, before his departure, gave in
turn a great entertainment to all the nobles of Florence, as well
as of Rome, who were in the city, he sent the first invitation to
Virgil, requesting him at the same time to invent for the
occasion a jest of the first magnitude.</p>
<p>So unto this for such occasion the magician gave all his
mind.&nbsp; And that the Emperor should really
&ldquo;<i>catch</i> the fly,&rdquo; he resolved that the jest
should be one at the Imperial expense&mdash;<i>e lo scherzo
voleva farlo a lui medesimo</i>.</p>
<p>After long meditation he exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Ecco</i>,
<i>l&rsquo; ho trovato</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got it!&nbsp; I will
give him a girl made of water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith he wrote to the Emperor that he would not fail to be
at the festival, but also begged permission to bring with him a
beautiful young lady&mdash;his cousin.</p>
<p>The Emperor, who was very devoted to the fair sex, inferred
from this directly that the jest was to be of a kind which would
please all free gallants&mdash;that is to say, the being
introduced to some easy and beautiful conquest&mdash;either
wedded or a maid.&nbsp; And, delighted at the thought <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>that the
trick would take this turn, he replied to Virgil that he had
<i>carta biancha</i>, or full permission to bring with him
whomever he pleased.</p>
<p>Then the magician made a woman of ice and light and water,
clear as the light of day he made her, and touched her thrice
with his wand, and lo! she became beautiful&mdash;but such a
beauty, indeed, that you would not find the like in going round
the world; the sun or moon ne&rsquo;er shone upon her like, for
she was made of star-rays and ice and dewdrops, so that she
looked like all the stars swimming in a burnished golden sky, and
shining like the sun, so resplendent in her beauty that she
dazzled the eyes.</p>
<p>When Virgilio arrived at the palace, all the guests were there
before him, and they were so overwhelmed with blank amazement at
the sight of the sorcerer with such a beauty, that they, in
silence and awed, drew apart on either side, leaving open space
through which Virgilio passed to the Emperor.&nbsp; And the
latter was himself for a minute stupefied at the sight of such
brilliancy and beauty, when, recovering himself, he gave his arm
to the fair cousin, and asked her name.&nbsp; To which she
replied: &ldquo;<i>La Donna di Diaccio</i>&rdquo; (ice).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Donna di Fuoco</i>! (Our Lady of Fire), <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> rather,&rdquo; cried the Emperor,
&ldquo;since all hearts are inflamed at thy beauty.&nbsp; Truly,
I had no idea that the great poet had such a lovely
cousin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dance began, and the Emperor would have no other partner
than this lady, who outshone the rest as the moon the stars, and
yet surpassed them even more by her exquisite grace in every
movement, and by her skill as a dancer, so that one seemed to see
a thousand exquisite statues or studied forms of grace succeeding
to one another as she moved.&nbsp; Nor was she less fascinating
in her language than in her beauty, and no wonder, for Virgilio
had called into the form one of the wittiest and most gifted of
all the fairies to aid the jest.</p>
<p>So the dance swept on, and the Emperor, utterly enchanted,
forgot Virgilio and his promised jest, and the time, and the
court, and all things save the beauty beside him.&nbsp; Finally
he withdrew with her to a side-room, where, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>sending for
refreshment, he sat pouring forth wine into himself and love into
the ears of the lady by turns.</p>
<p>Virgil, indeed, wishing the Emperor to have a fine time of it
for awhile, did nothing to disturb the splendid pair.&nbsp; But
as daybreak would soon appear, he spoke to one and another,
saying that he had promised the Emperor a merry jest to make them
all laugh.&nbsp; Whereupon there was a general cry for the
diversion, and by one consent the gay company invaded the room
where the fond couple sat.</p>
<p>Then Virgil, with the greatest politeness and a laughing air,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, your Highness, but it seems that my fair
cousin here has so engrossed you that you have forgotten that you
laid an absolute command on me that I should prepare and play
some rare jest, the like of which you had never seen, and I fear,
should I forget it, you may ne&rsquo;er forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Emperor, good-natured and grateful to the poet for
his fair cousin&rsquo;s sake, excused the intrusion, and begged
for the jest, expressing a hope that it would be a thoroughly
good one.</p>
<p>Then Virgil said to the Emperor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my cousin upon thy lap, and let her arms be round
thy neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Per Bacco</i>!&rdquo; cried the Emperor, &ldquo;the
jest begins well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now embrace her firmly!&rdquo; exclaimed
Virgil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better and better!&rdquo; quoth the Emperor.</p>
<p>Then Virgil spoke solemnly to the lady, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is thy name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donna di Diaccia,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Lady of Ice,&rdquo; replied the wondrous man,
&ldquo;in the name of my magic power, I summon you to return to
the ice from which you sprung, and to the water from which you
were born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then little by little, as she sat in the Emperor&rsquo;s lap,
the beautiful girl became a brilliant block of ice, and truly the
great man, as his fingers and all his person began to freeze, was
fain to place the image on the sofa, where they saw it presently
thaw&mdash;features and feet and all dispersing, and running away
in a stream, till every trace had flown, and the Emperor and the
company understood that they had been admiring a Woman of
Water.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>There
was a pause of utter bewilderment, as of awe, at this strange
ending, and then a roar of laughter, in which the Emperor himself
finally joined, crying: &ldquo;<i>Viva Virgilio</i>!&nbsp; Long
may he flourish with his magic art!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the feast
ended with the clattering of cups, laughter, and merry
cheers.</p>
<p>[So the Donna di Diaccio was a spirit?&nbsp;
Certainly&mdash;the Spirit of Ice-water.&nbsp; If there is spirit
in vermouth, why should there not be one in the iced water which
you mix with it?]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Virgilio was as great a magician as he was a distinguished
post.&nbsp; And of the great works which he did when alive many
are yet remembered here in Florence, and among other things his
skill was such that by means of it he made statues sing and
dance.</p>
<p><i>Ecco come avenne</i>&mdash;behold how it came to
pass!&nbsp; It chanced one day that when walking alone in the
environs of Florence, he found himself in a place where there
were four <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>very beautiful Venuses. <a name="citation67"></a><a
href="#footnote67" class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; And looking at
them with great admiration, and observing their forms, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly they all please me well; and if they could
converse I hardly know which I would choose for a
companion.&nbsp; <i>Ebbene</i>!&nbsp; I will make them all talk
and walk, live and move, and can then see if anyone of them will
show any gratitude for the gift of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took human fat, and anointed with it all the statues,
and then of the blood of a wild boar, and rubbed it very
thoroughly over them, and when this was done he waved his magic
wand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of my magic art and power I order you to
speak and move and live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this they all awoke, as it were, from a long dream,
and stepping down from their pedestals, they walked about,
seeming far more beautiful than before.&nbsp; And they gathered
round Virgil, for truly they were enchanted with him as well as
by him, in more ways than one, and embraced and kissed him with a
thousand caresses and endearments, and each and all wished him to
select her as his mate.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio, laughing, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know not which to choose among the
four;<br />
I cannot make all four into a wife;<br />
But to determine who shall be the first,<br />
Do ye go forth and seek each one a gift,<br />
And come to-morrow evening to my house,<br />
And she who brings the gift which I prefer<br />
Shall be the fair one first preferred by me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the following eve the first who came was the Venus
Agamene; thus was she called who brought the first gift, and this
was a splendid diamond.&nbsp; Virgilio received it with
admiration, but said that he must wait to see what the others
would bring before he could decide.</p>
<p>Then the second was announced, whose name was Enrichetta, and
she presented a marvellous garment, richly embroidered and
adorned.&nbsp; And this too was admired; but to her also Virgilio
said he would await what was to come.</p>
<p>The third, whose name was Veronica, brought such a wonderful
bouquet of flowers that the magician was more <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>pleased with
it than he had been by the diamond or the robe.</p>
<p>Then there came the fourth, called Diomira, and she brought a
splendid crown of &mdash;. <a name="citation68"></a><a
href="#footnote68" class="citation">[68]</a>&nbsp; And Virgil
preferred this to all, and gave the prize to Diomira.&nbsp; So he
bade them all come the next evening to a grand festival.&nbsp;
And when they came, it was indeed a wonderful assembly, for there
were present, and in life, all the statues from all the
palaces.&nbsp; They came down from their pedestals and danced in
the house of Virgilio&mdash;nor did they return until the early
dawn; and so it came to pass that on that night all the statues
spoke and danced.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They danced so merrily all the night,<br />
Till the sun came in with a rosy light,<br />
And touched the statues fair,<br />
When in an instant every one<br />
Was changed again to marble stone.<br />
Per Bacco!&nbsp; I was there!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is not remarkable that there should be so many tales in
Italy of statues speaking or coming to life.&nbsp; They abounded
among the Romans, and are to be found in later literature.&nbsp;
Bonifacius, in his &ldquo;Ludicra,&rdquo; as I have said,
collects instances of men who have loved statues, and Zaghi, whom
I shall quote again directly, does the same.&nbsp; But the idea
of images speaking is so natural that we need not have recourse
to tradition to account for its existence.</p>
<p>Among the archaic and very curious traditions in this tale we
are told that Virgil rubbed the statues with human fat and the
blood of a wild boar.&nbsp; Both of these occur not only in
witchcraft, but also in the wild science of the earlier time, as
potent to give or take life.&nbsp; For the blood of a boar that
of a bull is equivalent.&nbsp; In the recipes for preparing the
celebrated poison of the Borgias one or the other is
presented.&nbsp; That of the <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>boar still exists in the poisoning
common in Germany caused by eating <i>Blutwurst</i>.&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Selva di Curiosit&agrave;,&rdquo; by Gabriel Zaghi, 1674,
there is a chapter (xx.) devoted to showing that bull&rsquo;s
blood&mdash;<i>sangue di toro</i>&mdash;is a deadly poison; to
prove this he cites Plutarch, Pliny, Dioscorides, and others,
from which it appears that the idea is ancient.&nbsp; That it
gives life to statues in the tale is quite in keeping with the
strange and rude hom&oelig;opathy which is found in Paracelsus,
and all the writers on mystical medicine of his time, from which
Hahnemann drew his system, <i>i.e.</i>, that what will kill can
also cure, or revive.</p>
<p>It is very remarkable that in this tale Agamene brings a
diamond.&nbsp; According to Hyginius (&ldquo;Astronom.,&rdquo;
II., 13, <i>vide</i> Friedrich, &ldquo;Symbolich der
Natur.,&rdquo; p. 658), Aega (or Aegamene) nursed the youthful
Jupiter.&nbsp; In another legend (No. 1) Virgil is the son of
Jove.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aega was a daughter of the Sun, and of such
brilliancy that the Titans, dazzled by her splendour, begged
their mother <i>G&auml;a</i>, or Gea, to hide her in the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This clearly indicates a diamond.&nbsp;
Jupiter transformed her into a star.</p>
<p>It is simply possible, and only a conjecture of mine, that in
Diomira we find the name of Diomedea, the <i>Diomedea
necessitas</i> of Plato (&ldquo;De Repub,&rdquo; lib. 6), who
carried all before her.&nbsp; Diomira conquers all her rivals in
this legend.&nbsp; She is the <i>Venus Victrix</i>.</p>
<p>I cannot help believing when we find such curious instances of
tradition as that of Aega, or Agamene, surviving in these tales,
that there is a possibility that the whole story may, more or
less, be of classic or very ancient origin.&nbsp; We are not as
yet able to <i>prove</i> it, and so there are none who attach
much value to these <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>fragments.&nbsp; But a day will come when scholars will
think more of them.&nbsp; That there still survives a great deal
of Gr&aelig;co-Latin lore which was not recorded by classic
writers has become to us a certainty.&nbsp; Therefore it is
possible, though not now to be proved, that these statues of
Virgil had a common origin with the image of Selostre, or
<i>Testimonium luminis</i>, described by Pausanius, which spoke
when the sun rose or at the Aurora.</p>
<p>If it be possible, and it certainly is conjectural, that
Diomira is the same with Diadumena, we have beyond question a
very remarkable illustration of old tradition surviving in a
popular tale; for Diadumena, or &ldquo;She who binds her forehead
with a fillet,&rdquo; or band, was the name of one of the most
beautiful statues of Polycletus.&nbsp; According to Winkelmann
(&ldquo;Ist. dell Acte,&rdquo; lib. 6, cap. 2), this statue was
very frequently copied and familiarly known.&nbsp; A statue in
the Villa Farnese is believed to be an imitation of it.&nbsp;
Were this conjecture true, the gift brought by Diomira would be
the fillet which Virgil wears by tradition, as typical of a
poet.&nbsp; An ornament, fillet, or tiara is, effectively, a
crown.&nbsp; Therefore, the meaning of the myth is that a true
poet is such by necessity; he cannot help it&mdash;<i>poeta
nascitur</i>, <i>non fit</i>.</p>
<h2>VIRGIL, THE LADY, AND THE CHAIR.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now the golden chair wherein Juno was
compelled to sit, by the artifice of Vulcan, means that the earth
is the mother of riches, and with it that part of the air which
cannot leave the earth, Juno being air.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<p>&ldquo;Thou wolt algates wete how we be shape!<br />

Or Dante also.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>:
<i>The Frere&rsquo;s Tale</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There once lived in Rome a very great, rich, and beautiful
Princess, but she was as bad at heart as could be, and her life
was of the wickedest.&nbsp; However, she kept up a good
appearance, and was really at last in love with a fine young man,
who returned her affections.</p>
<p>But Virgil, knowing all, and pitying the youth, said to him
that the woman would certainly be the cause of his ruin, as she
had been of many others, and told him so many terrible things of
her, that he ceased to visit the Princess.</p>
<p>And she, first suspecting and then learning what Virgil had
done, fell into bitter hatred, and swore that she would be
revenged on him.</p>
<p>So one evening she invited the Emperor and many nobles, among
them Virgil, to a splendid supper.</p>
<p>And being petty and spiteful by nature, the Princess had
devised a mean trick to annoy Virgil.&nbsp; For she had prepared
with great craft a chair, the seat of which was of paper, but
which seemed to be of solid wood.&nbsp; It appeared to be a
handsome seat of great honour.</p>
<p>But when the great man sat on it, there was a great crash, and
he went down, indeed, but with his legs high in the air.&nbsp; So
there was a peal of laughter, in which he joined so heartily and
said so many droll things over it, that one would have thought he
had contrived the jest himself, at which the lady was more angry
than ever, since she had hoped to see him angry and
ashamed.&nbsp; And Virgil, taking all the blame of the accident
on himself, promised to send her in return a chair to pay for
it.&nbsp; And he requested leave <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>to take the proper measure for it, so
that she might be fitly taken in.</p>
<p>Which she was.&nbsp; For, having returned to his home, Virgil
went to work and had a splendid chair made&mdash;<i>con molto
artifizio</i>.&nbsp; With great art he made it, with much gold
inlaid with pearls, studded with gems.&nbsp; It was all
artificial. <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p>And having finished it, Virgil begged the Emperor to send it
to the Princess as a gift.</p>
<p>The Emperor did so at the proper time, but there was in it a
more cunning trick than in the one which she had devised.&nbsp;
For there were concealed therein several fine nets, or snares, so
that whoever sat in it could not rise.</p>
<p>Then the Princess, overjoyed at this magnificent gift, at once
sent an invitation to her friends to come to a supper where she
could display it; nor did she suspect any trick, having no idea
that she had any enemy.</p>
<p>And all came to pass as Virgil planned.&nbsp; For the lady,
having seated herself in great state, found herself caught, and
could not rise.</p>
<p>Then there was great laughter, and it was proposed that
everyone present should kiss her.&nbsp; And as one beginning
leads to strange ending, the end thereof was that they treated
her <i>senza vergogna</i>, saying that when a bird is once caught
in a snare, everybody who pleases may pluck a feather.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The classical scholar will find in this tale a probable
reminiscence of the chair made by Vulcan wherein to entrap Juno,
in which he succeeded, so that she was made to appear ridiculous
to all the gods.&nbsp; It is worth noting in this connection that
such chairs are made even to the present day, and that without
invisible nets or any magic.&nbsp; One is mentioned in a book
entitled &ldquo;The Life of Dr. Jennings the Poisoner&rdquo;
(Philadelphia, T. B. Peterson, Bros.).&nbsp; If any person sat in
it, he or she fell back, and certain clasps closed over the
victim, holding him or her down perfectly helpless, rendering
robbery or violence easy.&nbsp; Since <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>writing the foregoing, I have in a
recent French novel read a description of such a chair, with the
additional information that such seats were originally invented
for and used by physicians to confine lunatic patients.&nbsp; A
friend of mine told me that he had seen one in a house of
ill-fame in New York.</p>
<p>The legend of the Lady and the Chair suggests a very curious
subject of investigation.&nbsp; It is very probably known to the
reader that, to make a mesmerized or hypnotized subject remain
seated, whether he or she will or not, is one of the common
experiments of the modern magicians.&nbsp; It is thus described
by M. Debay in his work &ldquo;Les Myst&egrave;res du Sommeil et
Magnetisme.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>The operator asks the subject, &ldquo;Are you
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise from your chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>He
rises</i>.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell all present that you are not
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I am wide awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator takes the subject by the hand, leads him to
different persons present with whom he is acquainted, and asks
him if he knows them.&nbsp; He replies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Now sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>The
subject obeys</i>.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And now I forbid you to
rise.&nbsp; It is for you impossible&mdash;you cannot
move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject makes ineffectual efforts to rise, but remains
attached to the chair as if held fast by an invisible power.</p>
<p>The operator then says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you may rise.&nbsp; I permit you to do so.&nbsp;
Rise&mdash;I order it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject rises from the chair without an effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have frequently had occasion to observe that, in all of
these legends which I have received from witches, the story,
unlike the common fairy tale or <i>novella</i> of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>any kind, is
only, as it were, a painted casket in which is enclosed the jewel
of some secret in sorcery, generally with an incantation.&nbsp;
Was not this the case with many of the old myths?&nbsp; Do they
not all, in fact, really set forth, so far as their makers
understood them, the mysteries of Nature, and possibly in some
cases those of the wonder-works or miracles of the priests and
magicians?&nbsp; There was a German&mdash;I forget his
name&mdash;who wrote a book to prove that Jupiter, Juno, and all
the rest, were the elements as known to us now, and all the
wonders told of all the gods, with the
&ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; of Ovid, only a marvellous poetic
allegory of chemical combinations and changes.&nbsp; That
hypnotism was known to Egyptians of old is perfectly
established&mdash;at least to his own satisfaction&mdash;by Louis
Figuier in his &ldquo;Histoire du Merveilleux dans les Temps
Modernes,&rdquo; Paris, 1861; and it is extremely possible.&nbsp;
Therefore it may be that Juno in the chair is but the prototype
of a Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, or Angelique Cottin, or Marie
Raynard, or some other of the &ldquo;little Foxes,&rdquo; who, by
the way, are alluded to in the Old Testament.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>:
<i>The Knighte&rsquo;s Tale</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was in the oldest times in Florence a noble family, but
one so impoverished that their <i>giorni di festa</i>, or
feast-days, were few and far between.&nbsp; However, they dwelt
in their old palace, which was in the street now called the Via
Citadella, which was a fine old building, and so they lived in
style before the world, when many a day they hardly had anything
to eat.</p>
<p>Round this palace was a large garden in which stood an ancient
marble statue of a beautiful woman, running very rapidly, with a
dog by her side.&nbsp; She held in her hand a bow, and on her
forehead was a small moon; it seemed as if, instead of being in a
garden, she was in a forest hunting wild game.&nbsp; And it was
said that by night, when all was still and no one present, and
the moon shone, the statue became like life, and very beautiful,
and then she fled away and did not return till the moon set, or
the sun rose.</p>
<p>The father of the family had two children, a boy and a girl,
of nine or ten years of age, and they were as good as they were
intelligent, and like most clever children, very fond of curious
stories.</p>
<p>One day they came home with a large bunch of flowers which had
been given to them.&nbsp; And while playing in the garden the
little girl said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beautiful lady with the bow ought to have her share
of the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered her brother, &ldquo;because
I believe that she is as good as she is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Saying
this, they laid flowers before the statue, and made a wreath,
which the boy placed on her head.</p>
<p>Just then the great poet and magician Virgil, who knew
everything about the gods and <i>folletti</i>, whom people used
to worship, entered the garden, and said, smiling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made the offering of flowers to the goddess
quite correctly, as they did in old times; all that remains is to
make the prayer properly, and it is this.&nbsp; Listen, and learn
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bella dea dell arco!<br />
Bella dea delle freccie!<br />
Delia caccia e dei cani!<br />
Tu vegli colle stelle<br />
Quando il sole va dormir,<br />
Tu colla Luna in fronte,<br />
Cacci la notte meglio del di<br />
Colle tue Ninfe al suono<br />
Di trombe&mdash;sei la regina<br />
Dei cacciatori,<br />
Regina della notte!<br />
Tu che siei la cacciatrice<br />
Pi&ugrave; potente di ogni<br />
Cacciator&mdash;ti prego<br />
Pensa un poco a noi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely Goddess of the bow!<br />
Lovely Goddess of the arrows!<br />
Of all hounds and of all hunting;<br />
Thou who wakest in starry heaven<br />
When the sun has gone to sleep;<br />
Thou with moon upon thy forehead<br />
Who the chase by night preferrest<br />
Unto hunting by the day,<br />
With thy nymphs unto the sound<br />
Of the horn&mdash;thou Queen of Hunters!<br />
Queen of night, thyself the huntress,<br />
And most powerful, I pray thee,<br />
Think, although but for an instant,<br />
Upon us who pray unto thee!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Virgil taught them the <i>Scongiurazione</i>, or spell to
the goddess Diana:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bella dea dell&rsquo; arco del cielo,<br />
Delle stelle e della Luna.<br />
La regina pi&ugrave; potente<br />
Dei cacciatori e della notte;<br />
A te riccoriamo,<br />
E chiedamo il tuo aiuto<br />
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Che tu
possa darci<br />
Sempre la buona fortuna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair goddess of the rainbow!<br />
Of the stars and of the moon!<br />
The queen all-powerful<br />
Of hunters and the night,<br />
We beg of thee thy aid<br />
To give good fortune to us!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he added the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Se la nostra scongiurazione,<br />
Ascolterai,<br />
E buona fortuna ci darei,<br />
Un segnale a noi lo darei!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;If thou heedest our evocation,<br />
And wilt give good fortune to us,<br />
Then give us in proof a token.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having taught them this, Virgilio departed.</p>
<p>Then the children ran to tell their parents all that had
happened, and the latter impressed it on them to keep it all a
secret, nor breathe a word or hint of it to anyone.&nbsp; But
what was their amazement, when they found early the next morning
before the statue a deer freshly killed, which gave them good
dinners for many a day&mdash;nor did they want thereafter at any
time game of all kinds.</p>
<p>There was a neighbour of theirs, a priest, who held in hate
all the idolatry of the olden time, and all which did not belong
to his religion, <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a> and he, passing the garden one day,
beheld the statue crowned with roses and (other) flowers.&nbsp;
And in a rage, seeing in the street a decaying cabbage, he rolled
it in the mud, and threw it, all dripping, at the face of the
statue, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ecco male bestia d&rsquo;idolo, questo e
l&rsquo;omaggio che io ti do, gia che il diavolo ti
aiuta!&rdquo;&mdash;(Behold, thou vile beast of an idol, this is
the homage which I render thee, and may the devil help thee!)</p>
<p>Then the priest heard a voice in the gloom where the trees
were thick, which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bene bene&mdash;tu mi hai fatto<br />
L&rsquo; offrande&mdash;tu avrai<br />
La tua porzione<br />
Di caccia.&nbsp; Aspetta!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;It is well&mdash;since thou hast made<br />
Thy offering, thou&rsquo;lt get thy portion<br />
Of the game&mdash;but wait till morning!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that night the priest suffered from horrible fancies and
fears, and when at last, just before three, he fell asleep, he
soon awoke from a nightmare, in which it seemed as if something
heavy rested on his chest.&nbsp; And something indeed fell from
him and rolled on the ground.&nbsp; And when he rose and picked
it up, and looked at it by the light of the moon, he saw that it
was a human head, half decayed. <a name="citation78a"></a><a
href="#footnote78a" class="citation">[78a]</a></p>
<p>Another priest who, hearing the cry which he had uttered,
entered his room, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that head.&nbsp; It is of a man whom I
confessed, and who was beheaded three months ago at
Siena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And three days after this the priest who had insulted the
goddess died.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In a single incident this tale recalls that of Falkenstein,
one of the synonyms of the wild huntsman in Germany, of whom it
is said that as he passed by, a reckless fellow wished him luck,
whereupon he heard the words, &ldquo;Thou hast wished me luck;
thou shalt share the game;&rdquo; whereat there was thrown to him
a great piece of carrion.&nbsp; And soon after he died. <a
name="citation78b"></a><a href="#footnote78b"
class="citation">[78b]</a>&nbsp; But the true plot of this
narrative is the conduct of the goddess Diana, who rewards the
children for their worship and punishes the priest for his
sacrilege.</p>
<p>And, noting the sincere spirit of heathenism which inspires
many of these legends, the belief in <i>folletti</i> and
<i>fate</i>, and curiously changed forms of the gods of
Gr&aelig;co-Roman mythology, still existing among the peasants,
it is worth inquiring whether, as the very practical Emperor
Julian believed, a sincerely religious and <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>moral spirit,
under any form, could not be adapted to the progress of
humanity?&nbsp; The truth is that as the heathen gods are one and
all, to us, as something theatrical and unreal, we think they
must have been the same to their worshippers.&nbsp; Through all
the Renaissance to the present day the pretended appreciation and
worship of classic deities, and with them of classic art and
mythology, reminds one of the French billiard-player Berger, who,
when desirous of making a very brilliant exhibition of his skill,
declared that he would invoke the god of billiards!&nbsp; They
may seem beautiful, but they are dead relics, and the worst is
that no one realizes now that they ever really lived, moved, and
had a being in the human heart.&nbsp; And yet the Italian witch
still has a spark of the old fire.</p>
<p>Diana Artemis is known to poets and scholars in certain varied
characters thus summed up by Browning:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a Goddess of the ambrosial courts,<br
/>
And save by Here, Queen of Pride, surpassed<br />
By none whose temples whiten this the world.<br />
Through Heaven I roll my lucid moon along;<br />
I shed in Hell o&rsquo;er my pale people peace;<br />
On Earth, I, caring for the creatures, guard<br />
Each pregnant yellow wolf and fox-bitch sleep,<br />
And every feathered mother&rsquo;s callow brood,<br />
And all that love green haunts and loneliness<br />
Of men; the chaste adore me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to her only believers and worshippers now left on
earth&mdash;such as Maddalena&mdash;Diana is far more than this,
for she is the queen of all witchcraft, magic, sorcery, the
mistress of all the mysteries, of all deep knowledge, and
therefore the greatest of the goddesses&mdash;all the rest, in
fact, except Venus and Bacchus, who only exist in oaths, being
now well-nigh forgotten and unknown to them.</p>
<h2><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>VIRGIL
AND THE SPIRIT OF MIRTH.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an ancient tale that a boy for
laughing at Ceres was turned into a stone.&nbsp; For truly too
much merriment hardens us all.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Comment on L. M.
Brusonii</i> &lsquo;<i>Faceti&aelig;</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ancient times there lived in Florence a young lord who was
very beautiful, and ever merry&mdash;and no wonder, because he
was <i>Il Dio della Allegria</i>&mdash;the God of
Mirth&mdash;himself.</p>
<p>He was greatly beloved, not only by his friends, but by all
the people, because he was always so joyous, kind-hearted, and
very charitable.</p>
<p>Every evening this spirit-lord went with his friends to the
theatre, or to his parties (<i>al circolo</i>), and the name by
which he was known was Eustachio.&nbsp; All awaited with
impatience his arrival, for with it the merriment began, and when
he came there was a joyous shout of &ldquo;Evviva il Dio
dell&rsquo; Allegria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came to pass that in a theatre Eustachio met with a girl, a
singer, of such marvellous beauty and wit, that he fell, like one
lost, in love with her; which love being reciprocated, he took
her to himself, and kept her in a magnificent home, with many
fine attendants, and all that heart could desire.&nbsp; In those
days every signore in Florence thus had an <i>amante</i>, and
there was great rivalry among them as to who should keep his
favourite in the best style&mdash;<i>con pi&ugrave; di
lusso</i>.&nbsp; And this lady so beloved by Eustachio, was not
only the most beautiful, but the most magnificently entertained
of any or all in the city.</p>
<p>Now, one evening there was a grand festival in a
<i>palazzo</i>, where there was dancing and gay conversation,
Eustachio being as usual present, for all his love for his lady
did not keep him from the world, or making mirth for all.&nbsp;
And as they diverted themselves or sung to music, there entered a
group of young lords, among whom was Virgilio, the great poet. <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>Then Eustachio rose and began to clap his hands and cry,
&ldquo;<i>Evviva</i>!&nbsp; Long live the great poet!&rdquo; and
those who were at table ceased to eat, and those who were dancing
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>left the
dance with their partners, and all in welcome cried,
&ldquo;<i>Evviva il gran poeta</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Eustachio begged Virgilio to sing, and the poet did so,
for there was no one who would have refused anything to
Eustachio, so winning were his ways.</p>
<p>So Virgil made him the subject of his song, telling in
pleasing verse how free he was from care, ever laughing like
sunshine, ever keeping himself free from thought, which kills joy
and brings sorrow.</p>
<p>And Eustachio, singing and laughing, said that it was because
he was ever among friends who banished thought, and so kept away
melancholy.</p>
<p>Then Virgil, still softly singing, asked him whether, if he
should lose his lady-love, he would not be melancholy for a time,
despite the consolations of friends and relations.</p>
<p>Eustachio replied that he would indeed regret the loss, and it
would make him sad for a time, but not as a settled grief or
incurable sorrow, for that all things pass away, every night hath
its morning, after every death new life, when the sea has sunk to
its lowest ebb then it rises, and that he who knows this can
never know trouble.</p>
<p>Virgil ended the dialogue of song by saying that he who
believes he can never be sad knows not what sorrow and trials
are, that grief must come some time or other to all, even to the
God of Mirth himself, and offered to make a wager of a banquet
for all present, if he could not within two weeks&rsquo; time
cause Eustachio to know what grief, and a melancholy which should
seem incurable, was like.</p>
<p>Eustachio assented, and said he would add a thousand gold
crowns to the bet.</p>
<p>There was a statue named Peonia to whom Virgil had given life;
and going to her, who was now as other women, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give life to a statue, but how to change a human
being to marble is beyond my power; I pray thee, tell me how I
may turn into an image, such as thou wert, this beautiful girl
whom Eustachio adores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peonia, smiling, replied: &ldquo;Before thou didst come
hither I knew thy thought and thy purpose.&nbsp; Lo! here I have
prepared a bouquet of flowers of such intense magic perfume that
it will make Eustachio love to madness, as he never did before;
but when his mistress inhales the perfume she will become a
statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>And as
she bid he did, and placed the bouquet in the lady&rsquo;s
chamber, and when she smelt at it she became a statue, and sat
holding the flowers.&nbsp; And Eustachio seeing her sitting there
in the dim twilight, knew not the truth, but also smelt of the
perfume, and became more in love than man can dream, but when he
found that the lady was petrified he was well-nigh mad with
grief, nor could anyone console him.&nbsp; And this passed into
an iron-like melancholy, nor would he leave the room where the
statue sat.</p>
<p>Now, the friends of all, though they well knew that Virgilio
had done this, still remembered that he had mighty and mysterious
power, and then, thinking over the wager, concluded that he had
been in some manner in the affair.&nbsp; So they went to him,
praying that he would do something to keep Eustachio from madness
or death.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio, the great master, went to the room where
Eustachio sat in profound grief by the statue, and said, with a
smile, &ldquo;<i>Caro giovane</i> (My dear youth), I have won my
wager, and expect to see thee this evening in the hall at the
banquet and dance, bringing the thousand crowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Virgilio,&rdquo; answered Eustachio, &ldquo;go to
my parents or friends, and receive thy gold, and assemble them
all to banquet or to dance; but do not expect me, for from this
room I never more will stir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Virgilio, gently removing the magic bouquet from the hand
of the statue, stepped to the window and threw it down into the
street&mdash;when lo! the lady flushed into life, and with a
laugh asked them what they were all doing there?&nbsp; And then
Eustachio burst out laughing for joy, and they danced in a circle
round Virgilio.&nbsp; Eustachio paid down the thousand crowns,
which Virgil gave as a wedding present to the bride&mdash;for of
course there was a wedding, and a grander banquet than
ever.&nbsp; But though he was the God of Mirth himself, Eustachio
never declared after this that he would or could never mourn or
think of grief.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>What is remarkable in this tale is the confusion between the
conception of the hero as a spirit, or the God of Mirth, and his
social condition as a young Italian gentleman about town.&nbsp;
It is this transition from the god to the popular hero, a mere
mortal, which forms the subject of Heine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gods in
Exile.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>There
is another Florentine legend, in which this god appears by the
more appropriate name <i>Momo</i>, evidently <i>Momus</i>, in
which a young lord who had never laughed in his life is made
merry for ever by having presented to him the image of a laughing
goblin, which one of his peasants had dug up in a ruin.&nbsp;
Whenever he looks at it, he bursts into a roar of laughter, which
has the effect of changing his character very much for the
better.</p>
<p>What is perhaps most significant in this tale is the name
<i>Peonia</i>.&nbsp; P&aelig;onia in classic mythology was
Minerva, as a healing goddess.&nbsp; As such, alone, she bears
the serpent.&nbsp; Esculapius is termed by Claudian the
<i>P&aelig;onio</i>&mdash;dragon or snake.&nbsp; In reference to
which I find the following in the &ldquo;Dizionario
Mitologico&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Peonia</i>, an additional name of
Minerva, worshipped . . . as guardian of health.&nbsp; Therefore
she has for a tribute the serpent, as emblem of the art of
healing.&nbsp; <i>Peonico</i> was a surname of Apollo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When medicine was synonymous with magic, Peonia-Minerva would
naturally appear as one familiar with occult arts.&nbsp; The
changing to a statue and being revived from a statue to life is a
very evident symbol of raising from death to life.&nbsp;
&AElig;sculapius, who was the male equivalent of Peonia, revived
corpses.&nbsp; As Minerva and other deities were familiar to the
people as statues, in which there was believed to be a peculiar
spirit or life, we can readily understand how any image of a
goddess was supposed to be at times revived.</p>
<p>Peonia in our story works her miracle by means of
flowers.&nbsp; This, if we are really dealing with an archaically
old Italian tradition, is marvellously significant.&nbsp; <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>The
<i>p&oelig;onia</i>, or peony, or <i>rose de N&ocirc;tre
Dame</i>, was believed in earliest Roman times to be <i>primus
inter magnos</i>, the very first and strongest of all floral
amulets, or to possess the greatest power in magic.&nbsp; This
was due to its extreme redness, this colour alone having great
force to resist the evil eye and sorcery.&nbsp; The most dreaded
of all deities among the earliest Etrusco-Latin races was Picus,
who appeared as a woodpecker, to which bird he had been changed
by Circe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nam Picus, etiam rex, ab eadem Circe virga
tactus, in volucrem picum evolavit,&rdquo; as Tritonius
declares.&nbsp; When people dug for treasure which was guarded by
this dreaded bird, he slew them unless they bore as a protecting
amulet the root of the peony.&nbsp; But there is a mass of
testimony to prove that the <i>p&aelig;onia</i>, or peony, was
magical.&nbsp; Many classic writers, cited by Wolf in his work on
amulets, 1692, declare its root drives away phantasms and
demons.&nbsp; It was held, according to the same writer, that the
same root protected ships from storms and houses from
lightning.&nbsp; It is true that this writer evidently confuses
the peony with the poppy, but the former was from earliest times
strong in all sorcery.</p>
<p>It is also curious that, in old tradition, Pygmalion the
sculptor is represented as indifferent to women.&nbsp; Venus
punishes him by making him fall in love with a statue.&nbsp;
Eustachio, the Spirit of Mirth, declares that the death of his
love would not cause him deep grief and for this P&aelig;onia and
Virgil change the lady into a marble image.&nbsp; It is the very
same story, but with the plot reversed.</p>
<p>Peonia, or peony, regarded as the poppy, since the two very
similar plants were beyond question often <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>confused, had
a deep significance as lulling to sleep&mdash;a synonym for
death, a reviving force&mdash;and it was also an emblem of love
and fertility (Pausanias, II., 10).&nbsp; Peonia lulls the lady
to sleep with flowers, that is, into a statue.</p>
<p>I do not regard it as more than <i>probable</i>, but I think
it possible that in this story we have one of the innumerable
<i>novelle</i> or minor myths of the lesser gods, which
circulated like fairy-tales among the Latin people, of which only
a small portion were ever written down.&nbsp; That there were
many of these not recorded by Ovid, and other mythologists, is
very certain, for it is proved by the scraps of such lore which
come to light in many authors and casual inscriptions.&nbsp; It
requires no specially keen imagination, or active faculty of
association, to observe that in this, and many other legends
which I have collected and recorded, there are beyond question
very remarkable relics of old faith and ancient tradition, drawn
from a source which has been strangely neglected, which neglect
will be to future and more enlightened antiquaries or historians
a source of wonder and regret.</p>
<p>A certain Giovanni Maria Turrini, in a collection of odds and
ends entitled &ldquo;Selva di Curiosit&aacute;,&rdquo; Bologna,
1674, declares that &ldquo;the peony, if patients be touched with
it, cures them of epilepsy, which results from the influence of
the sun, to which this plant is subject, the same effect
resulting from coral.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we also have the
restoring to life or reason, as if from death; that is to say,
from a fit or swoon.&nbsp; Truly, the ancients did not know
botany as we do, but there was for them far more poetry and
wonder in flowers.</p>
<p>Some time after all the foregoing was written I <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>found&mdash;truly to my great astonishment&mdash;that in
a novel by Xavier Montepin there is a student named Virgil, who
has a mistress named Pivoine&mdash;the title of the
book&mdash;which word is in Latin <i>P&aelig;onia</i>.&nbsp;
This, according to the kind of criticism which is now extensively
current, would settle the whole business, and determine
&ldquo;the undoubted original.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe it to be a
mere chance coincidence of names&mdash;strange, indeed, but
nothing more.&nbsp; For, in the first place, I am sure that my
collector or her informants are about as likely to have read the
<i>Sohar</i>, or &ldquo;Book of Light,&rdquo; or Hegel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia,&rdquo; as any novel whatever.&nbsp; But
the great part of what is curious in my narrative is not that
Virgil loves P&aelig;onia, but that P&aelig;onia-Minerva
depresses people to, or <i>raises them from</i>, <i>death by
means of flowers</i>.&nbsp; Very clearly in the Italian tale, as
in others, Virgil is a physician, and P&aelig;onia is his
counterpart, of all which there is no hint in the French
novel.</p>
<p>So it once befell that in a very strange Italian tale of
Galatea, the Spirit of the White Pebble, there was a narrative
agreeing in <i>names</i> with one in a romance by Eugene
Sue.&nbsp; But on carefully examining the account of the Virgins
of Sen, given by Pomponius Mela (Edition 1526, p. 34, for which
purpose I expressly purchased the book), I found that the legend,
as known to Maddalena, and also to an old woman whom she did not
know, contained the main element as given by Mela, which is
<i>not</i> to be found in the French story, namely, the
transmigration of the soul or metamorphosis into different
forms.&nbsp; The Latin writer states that such enchantresses are
called Gallicenas.&nbsp; Now, there was at one time a great
infusion of Celtic blood <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>into Northern Italy, and if it was in
correspondence with the Gauls, it <i>may</i> possibly be that the
story of Sen and Galatea of the White Stone passed all round.</p>
<p>It may be observed, however, that there may linger among
French peasants some legend of Virgil and Pivoine, or
P&aelig;onia, which Montepin had picked up, and should this be
so, doubtless there is some folklorist who can confirm it.&nbsp;
This is far more likely than that my authority took the names
from a French novel.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Mirth in this story has really nothing in common
with Momus, who was, in fact, the God of Sneering, or captious,
petty criticism of the kind which objects to great and grand or
beautiful subjects, because of small defects.&nbsp; The Virgilian
spirit is that of the minor rural gods, or the daughters of the
dawn, who were all smiling sub-forms of the laughing Venus.&nbsp;
These play the principal part in the mythology of the Tuscan
peasantry.&nbsp; This spirit differs from that of Momus as an
angel from a devil.</p>
<p>Psellus held that there was a soul in all statues.</p>
<p>That the God of Mirth, or Laughter, is in this tale also a gay
young cavalier in Florentine society is paralleled or outdone by
Chaucer in the &ldquo;Manciple&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; in which
Apollo is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whan Phebus dwelled here in erth adoun,<br
/>
As old&eacute; bookes maken mentioun,<br />
He was the most&eacute; lusty bacheler<br />
Of all this world, and eke the best archer. . . .<br />
Thereto he was the semelieste man<br />
That is or was sithen the world began.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, this &ldquo;flour of bachelerie as well in fredom as
in chivalrie&rdquo; was simply human while here below, having
&ldquo;a wif which that he loved more than his lif.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Chaucer wrote this evidently with conscious <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>humour of the
na&iuml;ve paradox by which those of his age could thus confuse
gods and common mortals, even as a Red Indian vaguely confuses
the great beaver or wolf with a human being.&nbsp; It is a
curious reflection that, at the present day in Italy, there are
believers in the old gods who regard the latter in the same way,
as half divine and half like other folk.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Seneca</span>:
<i>Epistol&aelig;</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was once in Rome a young Emperor named Nerone.&nbsp; As
a boy, he was by no means badly inclined, and it seemed for a
long time as if he would grow up into a great and good man.</p>
<p>He had a tutor or teacher named Seneco, <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a> who was <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>benevolent and wise beyond all the
men of his time, and he had such influence on the young Nerone,
that for two years the youth behaved well and did no harm to
anyone.</p>
<p>But little by little he was led astray by courtiers who
flattered and corrupted him, and who of course did all they could
to injure Seneco in his esteem, saying that the sage was really
an old knave, and that he was engaged in plots with the design of
becoming Emperor himself.&nbsp; And the end of it all was that
Nerone believed them.</p>
<p>So he sent a letter to Seneco, in which he declared that the
time had come for the old man to die; but that he might choose
his own manner of death by suicide.</p>
<p>Seneco, having read it, said: &ldquo;What an evil youth is
this, of what a corrupted heart!&nbsp; Well, infamous as the
command is, I will die!&nbsp; But I will leave him a legacy which
shall be his ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he wrote to Nerone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will die this very day, but I leave you a gift which
is more than a fortune.&nbsp; It is a book of magic and
necromancy.&nbsp; If you wish for anything, be it the love of a
woman or the death of a man, or his disaster, or to destroy all
Rome, you will find in the book spells by which it may be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he knew that Nerone had the book, he went at once
into a hot bath, and said to his surgeon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open my veins, so that I may bleed to death.&nbsp; I
will die, but I know that the Emperor will soon follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he died, and all Rome wept. <a name="citation89a"></a><a
href="#footnote89a" class="citation">[89a]</a></p>
<p>Then Nerone read the book, and it seemed as if it were
poisoned, for while reading it he perceived as it were an
exhalation <a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a> from hell.</p>
<p>He read in the book how to commit all crimes and sins, how to
seize on fortunes, or rob whom he would, and learned from it all
the secrets of licentiousness&mdash;<i>tutte cose
voluttiose</i>&mdash;and having finished it, he became a
veritable devil.</p>
<p>He collected many lions and tigers, and all kinds of terrible
wild beasts, and then drove among them all the Christians and
saints in Rome, and they were devoured by the beasts.&nbsp; Then
he took the fortunes of all the rich men, <a
name="citation89c"></a><a href="#footnote89c"
class="citation">[89c]</a> and decreed that all the women in the
city were his wives.&nbsp; After which he every day debauched
them in the open streets before their husbands, and likewise
ordained that all <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>men and women should do the same openly.&nbsp; And he
committed even more infamous deeds in public places, with an
orchestra, saying it was best to make love to the sound or
accompaniment of music.</p>
<p>And one day, to make a scene in an opera, he (set fire to and)
burned all Rome.</p>
<p>Then the people made a revolution, and drove him out of his
palace.&nbsp; It is said that this palace was all gilded.&nbsp;
(<i>Era tutto dorato</i>.)</p>
<p>In a public square was a statue of Seneco, and it was of
marble.&nbsp; So the people in a rage drove Nerone before them
until, utterly weary and exhausted, he fell down at the foot of
the statue of Seneco.&nbsp; And beholding the image of his tutor,
Nerone cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tu mi vincesti</i>, <i>tu mi
inperasti</i>&mdash;Thou hast conquered, O Seneco; thou hast
prevailed over me, and had thy revenge!&nbsp; And accursed be the
day in which thou didst send me the book which gave me the power
to have all which I desired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all who were present were astonished when they heard the
statue reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am avenged, and thou art punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a butcher struck him heavily; he gave him a death-wound
with an axe, and Nerone, dying, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hast no shame for having killed an Emperor,
thou shouldst at least blush at having put to death the best
actor in Rome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the ground opened, and there came forth the flame and
thunder of hell, with many devils who howled. . . .</p>
<p>And so did Nero die, who was the most infamous king <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> who ever lived in this world since it
was a world.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Though there are so many authentic traits of the Emperor Nero
in this tradition, the reader is not to infer from them that she
who wrote it has had access to a copy of Suetonius.&nbsp; There
is a &ldquo;halfpenny dreadful,&rdquo; or <i>sou</i> shocker,
entitled the &ldquo;Life of Nero&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Vita di
Nerone</i>&mdash;published by Adriano Salani, the Catnach of
Florence, Via Militare, No. 24 (No. 107 on <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>his
catalogue), to say nothing of other halfpenny classical works,
such as the &ldquo;Story of the Proud Emperor,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Empress Flavia,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Tale of Pyramus and
Thisbe,&rdquo; which, as they are to be found on many open-air
stands, may account for a great deal of such learning in the
popular mind.&nbsp; One may meet daily in Italy with marvellous
proof in many forms of what a strange, curious, confused mass of
old Latin lore still lingers among the people, and the marvellous
contrast which it presents to what the common folk read and
reflect over in other lands.&nbsp; But Nero would be most likely
to be remembered, because he is frequently mentioned or described
in popular Lives of the Saints as a great maker of martyrs, and
caster of them unto lions.</p>
<p>This does not belong to the cycle of Virgilian tales, but it
was sent to me as one from Siena.&nbsp; To my collector it was
all one, so that it referred to a magician, and had the idea
occurred to the writer, the name of Virgilio would have been
substituted for that of Seneca.&nbsp; Doubtless in their time,
since they began life in India, or Egypt, or Arabia, these
legends have borne many names, and been as garments to the memory
of many sages&mdash;even as Buddha in his Jatakas was the first
of a line which has ended in the heroes of European
nurseries.</p>
<p>The halfpenny, or <i>soldo</i>, or <i>sou</i> ballad of Nero,
to which I have referred, is too curious as illustrating the
remarkable knowledge of classical antiquity still current among
the Italian people, to be lightly passed by.&nbsp; Its title-page
is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Storia di Nerone, dove si narrano, le
Stragi, i Delitti, le Persecuzioni e gli Incendi commessi da
questo infame Tiranno in Roma&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;History of
Nero; in which is told <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the Murders and Crimes committed by
this Infamous Tyrant in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem and others of the same stamp are quite as
barbarously classic-medi&aelig;val or Romanesque as anything in
any of these stories of Virgilio, and if I cite it, it is to give
a clear idea of the remarkable degree to which strange
traditions, and very ancient legends or &ldquo;learning,&rdquo;
have lingered among the people.&nbsp; I really cannot understand
why this marvellous survival of old Latin romance, and this
spirit of the Dark Ages among the people, attracts so little
attention among literary people, and especially Italians.&nbsp;
For it certainly indicates to any thinking mind the survival of a
great deal of classic tradition which has never been
recorded.</p>
<h2>VIRGIL AND CICERO.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Magic is genius most mysterious,<br />
And poetry is genius passed to form,<br />
And these allied give birth to Eloquence;<br />
For never yet was there an orator<br />
Who did not owe his best to Poetry.&rdquo;&mdash;C. G. L.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was once a young man named Cicero, who was a student
with Virgil, and who, being poor, served the great magician in
all things.</p>
<p>When Christmas came, with the New Year, Virgil, being well
pleased with his fidelity, resolved to make a handsome gift to
Cicero, and so said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Che vuoi</i>?&nbsp; What wilt thou have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like,&rdquo; replied young Cicero, &ldquo;to be
master of the art of speech&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Il dono di parlar
bene</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you not prefer wealth?&rdquo; asked Virgil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who hath a ready tongue can have his will mid old or
young,&rdquo; answered Cicero; &ldquo;and as the proverb
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chi ha eloquenza,<br />
Ad ogni cosa ha pretenza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who hath but eloquence<br />
Hath unto everything pretence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;But do not forget,&rdquo; remarked Virgil,
&ldquo;that amiable speech is courteous and refined.&nbsp; And
remember to always speak well of
women&mdash;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If it be false, or if it be true,<br />
Speak gently of women, whatever you do.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a while Cicero, wanting change of life or to try his
fortune, left Virgil and Rome, going first to Florence and then
to Ravenna, where his parents dwelt.</p>
<p>So ever travelling on afoot, he came one night to a solitary
place among rocks in a forest, where he saw at some distance a
ruined castle.&nbsp; And entering, hoping to find a place to
sleep, he was astonished to perceive a light, and going further,
came into a spacious hall, where, seated at a table, were six
gentlemen and a lady, all of them far more beautiful and
magnificent in every respect than ordinary mortals, especially
the lady, who, as Cicero thought, surpassed all women whom he had
ever seen, as the moon outshines the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Salve Domine</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the scholar;
&ldquo;and excuse my intrusion, since I did not expect to find
company here, though I would have indeed come many a day&rsquo;s
journey, had I known of it, to behold such handsome and brilliant
cavaliers, and such a marvel of beauty as yon lady, as all the
world would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast a smooth tongue and a sweet gift of
speech,&rdquo; replied the lady, with a smile; &ldquo;and I not
only thank thee for the whole company, but invite thee to sup
with us, and lodge here, and be most welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they supped gaily; and Cicero, who from the company of
Virgil and his friends and the court was familiar with the world,
was amazed, and wondered who these marvellous people could
be.&nbsp; At last he chanced to ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day of the week is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly you can here take your choice,&rdquo; replied the
lady, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of all the days of the week,
which do you prefer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; replied Cicero; &ldquo;because it is the
only one which bears a woman&rsquo;s name or that of Venus.&nbsp;
<i>Evviva Venere</i>, <i>evviva le donne</i>!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Venus, whate&rsquo;er befall!<br
/>
Long life unto love, and to ladies all!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;This youth has a tongue of gold and honey,&rdquo;
said the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what do you think of the other
days of the week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other people do not think much about them in any
way,&rdquo; replied Cicero.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that is not the case
with me.&nbsp; To me they are all saints and gods.&nbsp;
<i>Domenica</i> is a holy name, which praises the Lord.&nbsp;
<i>Giovedi</i> (Tuesday) is the day of Jove, and that is a
glorious name.&nbsp; <i>Evviva Giove</i>!&nbsp; So it is with
them all; and were I rich enough, I would build a temple to the
days of the week wherein to worship them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That money shall not be wanting, O thou happy
man!&rdquo; replied the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowest thou who we
are?&nbsp; We are the Seven Days of the Week; and for what thou
hast said of me, every Friday thou shalt find a hundred gold
crowns under thy pillow.&nbsp; And when thou needest any special
favour, then pray to us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he heard the last word Cicero fell asleep.&nbsp; When
he awoke he was alone in the ruin, but by him was a purse with
one hundred crowns in gold.</p>
<p>Then in time Cicero built the temple, as he had promised, to
Venus, and in it he placed all the images of the seven
gods.&nbsp; Then whoever wanted a favour invoked those deities,
as indeed did Cicero when he needed aught; and those gods were
the seven youths, and those youths whom he had found in the hall
were the days of the week.</p>
<p>Then for a time Cicero lived in happiness.&nbsp; But something
came to disturb it, for one morning he saw at a window near by a
young lady of such marvellous beauty that he was as if enchanted,
nor was she less pleased with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, thou splendid star,&rdquo; said Cicero,
&ldquo;the very truth now passing in thy mind.&nbsp; Dost thou
love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In very truth,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I do love
thee.&nbsp; O Cicero, but thou lovest only to lose, for this day
I am to leave Rome never to return, unless thou canst by some
miracle so manage it as to prevent the journey, and keep me
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Cicero went to the Temple of the Days and conjured them
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lunedi e Marte! (Martedi.)<br />
Fai che la stella mia non parta!<br />
Mercurio e Giove!<br />
Fai che la stella non mova!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Monday and Tuesday,<br />
I pray you cause my love to remain!<br />
Wednesday and Thursday,<br />
Let her not move!<br />
Venus, thou who art the fairest day,<br />
The one whom I most adore!<br />
Thou who hast put me in the way of wealth,<br />
And unto whom I truly built a temple,<br />
As I did promise in the bygone time,<br />
And as thou thyself didst promise,<br />
That if I needed aught, and came to thee,<br />
My wishes should be granted, now I pray<br />
To Venus and to Saturn&mdash;Saturday,<br />
That as I have no peace, and none can know,<br />
Till I have won the maid, give her to me!<br />
And thou, O Sunday, when the wedding comes,<br />
I pray thee give her to me with thy hand!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then a voice from the depth of the temple replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because thou hast spoken so well,<br />
What thou hast asked is granted;<br />
She whom thou lovest<br />
Is not of the race of men;<br />
She is an enchantress,<br />
Born of Venus, who loves her,<br />
Venus, who bent her to love thee;<br />
The grace is granted:<br />
Wed and be happy!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pretty and fanciful, or strange, tale recalls that in the
&ldquo;Pentamerone&rdquo; of Gianbattista Basile, the Neapolitan,
in which a young man meets the Twelve Months in human form, and
pleases March by speaking well of him.&nbsp; In this story the
hero is a famed orator, who not only possesses the
<i>gaber</i>&mdash;or &ldquo;gift of the gab&rdquo;&mdash;but of
whom we are told how he came by it, namely, from Virgil, whose
verse has indeed for ages wakened eloquence in many hearts.</p>

96</span>According to this, Friday is the luckiest day, because
Frey was the god who gave good fortune, and Freya, his female
counterpart, was the Northern Venus.&nbsp; The Italian names with
their gods correspond to ours, as the deities of the North
resembled those of the Latin pantheon.&nbsp; As this is an
interesting subject, I take from the Italian
Historical-Mythological Dictionary the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Settimana</i> is a time composed of
seven days.&nbsp; Dion Cassius asserts that the Egyptians were
the first to divide time into periods of seven days, and that it
was suggested by the seven planets.&nbsp; However, the ancients
in this did not follow the rule, since in that case we should
have had Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the
Moon.&nbsp; Saturday, Sabato, is derived from Saturn, who ruled
the first hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was, in fact, from the disposition of the <i>hours</i> that
the days of the week received their names; hence the
transposition of names, as is very ingeniously worked out by the
author.</p>
<p>It is almost amusing to observe that in this, as in all tales
coming from a witch source, the incantations, though not at all
necessary to the story, are given with scrupulous care.</p>
<p>To the reader who would seriously study Cicero, yet in a
deeply interesting form, I commend &ldquo;Cicero and his
Friends,&rdquo; by Gaston Bussier (London: A. D. Innes and Co.,
1897).&nbsp; According to this genial and vigorous French writer,
there is a great deal of mystery as to the manner in which the
noble orator acquired the money to purchase estates and villas,
when he was notoriously devoid of income.&nbsp; It is true that a
great deal of public money was passing through his hands just
then, but as he was as incorruptible and pure as an average
American <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>senator, of course <i>this</i> cannot account for his
acquisitions.&nbsp; Here the legend comes to our aid and meets
the difficulty.&nbsp; Having the Seven Days to draw upon, which
probably means infinite extension of time and renewal of his
notes, the great Roman, borrowing, like his friend C&aelig;sar,
by millions, got along very comfortably.&nbsp; In fact, they
borrowed so much that all Rome was interested in their
prosperity, and helped to make them rich that they might pay.</p>

<p>Many centuries have passed since there was (worshipped) in
Florence a goddess who was the great spirit of virtue and
chastity, (yet) when a maid had gone astray she always devoted
herself to worship the beautiful Avesta, as this deity was
called, and the latter never failed in such case to get her
devotee out of the difficulty.&nbsp; Her temple was that building
which is now called the Baptistery of Saint John, and she was the
goddess of light, as of candles, torches, and all that
illuminates.&nbsp; And Avesta was, as I have said, known as the
deity of virtue, albeit many of the people shrugged their
shoulders when they heard this, being evidently strongly inclined
to doubt, but they said nothing for fear of punishment.</p>
<p>For it was rumoured that Avesta had many lovers, and that in
the rites of her religion there were secrets too dark to
discover, and that as everything in her worship was involved in
mystery and carried on occultly, it followed, of course, that it
involved something wrong.&nbsp; And it was observed that once a
month many women who worshipped her met in her temple by night,
and that they were accompanied by their lovers, who with them
adored the goddess in the form of a large lighted lamp.&nbsp; But
that <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>when
this rite was at an end and the multitude had departed, there
remained unnoted a number, by whom the doors were closed and the
light extinguished, when a general orgy ensued, no one knowing
who the others might be. <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; And it was
from this came the saying which is always heard when two lovers
are seated together by a light and it goes out, that Avesta did
it. <a name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a></p>
<p>There was in Florence a young lord who loved a lady of great
beauty.&nbsp; But she had a bitter rival, who to cross their love
had recourse to sorcery or witchcraft, and so &ldquo;bound&rdquo;
or cast on him a spell which weakened his very life, and made him
impotent and wretched, that his very heart seemed to be turned to
water.</p>
<p>And this spell the witch worked by taking a padlock and
locking it, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chiudo la catena,<br />
Ma non chiudo la catena,<br />
Chiudo il corpo e l&rsquo;anima<br />
Di questo bel signor ingrato,<br />
Chi non ha voluto,<br />
Corrispondermi in amore, <a name="citation98c"></a><a
href="#footnote98c" class="citation">[98c]</a><br />
Ha preferito un&rsquo; altra a me,<br />
E questa io l&rsquo;odio<br />
Come odio la signorina,<br />
Pure catena che incateni<br />
Tanti diavoli tieni!<br />
Tengo incatenata questo signor<br />
Fino a mio comando<br />
Che nessuno la possa disciogliere<br />
E incatenato possa stare,<br />
Fino che non si decidera<br />
Di sposarmi. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here I close the lock,<br />
Yet &rsquo;tis not a lock which I close;<br />
I shut the body and soul<br />
Of this ungrateful lord,<br />
Who would not meet my love,<br />
But loves another instead,<br />
Another whom I hate,<br />
Whom I here lock and chain<br />
With devil&rsquo;s power again.<br />
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>I hold
this man fast bound<br />
That none shall set him free<br />
Until I so command,<br />
And bound he shall remain<br />
Till he will marry me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day Virgil was passing the Piazza del Duomo, when he met
with the young man who had thus been bound or bewitched, and the
victim was so pale and evidently in terrible suffering, that the
great poet and magician, who was ever pitying and kind, was moved
to the heart, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair youth, what trouble have you, that you seem to be
in such suffering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man replied that he, being in love unto life and
death, had been bewitched by some malignant sorcery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can well see,&rdquo; replied the sage,
&ldquo;and I am glad that it will be an easy thing for me to cure
you.&nbsp; Go thou into a field which is just beyond Fiesole, in
a place among the rocks.&nbsp; There thou wilt find a flat stone
bearing a mark.&nbsp; Lift it, and beneath thou wilt find a
padlock and chain.&nbsp; Take this golden key: it is enchanted,
for with it thou canst open any lock in the world of door or
chain. <a name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a>&nbsp; Keep the lock, open it, and then
go to the Temple of Vesta and return thanks with prayer, and wait
for what will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the young man did as Virgil had told him, and among the
rocks found the stone and the padlock, and went to the Temple of
Avesta, where he opened the lock and made the prayer to the
goddess, which having done, he fell asleep, and no one beheld
him.</p>
<p>And while he was there the young lady entered the Baptistery
to worship Avesta, to offer her devotions, which being ended, she
sat down and also fell into a deep sleep, and no one observed
her.</p>
<p>But later in the night, when the doors were closed and the
light extinguished, and the worshippers who remained were calling
&ldquo;Avesta!&rdquo; the two sleepers who were side by side were
awakened by a rustling of silk, and this was caused by the dress
of the goddess, who roused them.&nbsp; And the young man found
himself restored to vigorous health and unwonted passion, and
quickly noting that a lady was by him, and carried away by
feelings beyond his control, <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>embraced and kissed her&mdash;nor
did she indeed resist, for the will of Avesta was on them
both.&nbsp; But noting that the lady had a silk handkerchief <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a> partly out of her pocket, he adroitly
stole it, putting in its place his own, and so with a kiss he
left her, neither knowing who the other was.&nbsp; But on
awaking, as if it were from a dream or a delirium, the lady was
overcome with shame and grief, and could only think that madness
or magic had overcome her reason, to cause her to yield as she
had done.&nbsp; For this morning she felt more passionately in
love with her betrothed than she had ever done before, and this
was because the spell which had bound her was broken with the
opening of the padlock.</p>
<p>But what was the astonishment of the lover, who was also
restored to all his health and strength, when in the morning he
looked at the handkerchief which he had carried away and found
embroidered on it the arms and name of his love!&nbsp; So he went
to visit her, and his greeting was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signorina, have you lost a handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; replied the lady,
amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the one in your pocket, and then at
<i>this</i>,&rdquo; was his laughing reply.</p>
<p>She did so, and understanding all in an instant, cried out in
shame and horror, while she became at first like blood and then
milk.&nbsp; Then the gentleman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Signorina, that we must by mistake have
exchanged handkerchiefs last night in the dark, and no wonder,
considering the fervency of our devotions.&nbsp; And since we
have begun to worship and pray so devoutly, and have entered on
such a good path, it were a pity for us to turn back, and
therefore it were well for us to continue to travel on it hand in
hand together.&nbsp; But I propose that instead of changing
pocket-handkerchiefs, we exchange rings before the altar and get
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady laughed and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept with great pleasure, Signore, the
handkerchief; just as the women in Turkey do when it is thrown to
them.&nbsp; And you know the proverb:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;La donna chi prende<br />
Tosto si rende<br />
E poi si vende.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;She who will take will give herself away,<br />
And she who gives will sell herself, they say.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Even so will I sell mine for thine; but you must take
the bargain on the nail, and the ball on the bound in the game of
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;I do so with
all my heart.&nbsp; But as for our handkerchiefs, I now see that
it is true that the peasant does not always know what it is that
he carries home in his bag from the mill.&nbsp; Thanks be to
Avesta that we found such good flour in our sacks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Vesta and to Virgil be all praise!&rdquo; replied
the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I think that while we continue our
daily worship in the temple, we will go there no longer by
night.&nbsp; <i>Vi sono troppo donne devote nel
buio</i>&rdquo;&mdash;There are too many lady devotees there in
the darkness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As a mere story this legend were as well left out, but it is
one of a hundred as regards curious relics of mythologic and
other lore.&nbsp; Firstly, be it observed that a secret doctrine,
or esoteric as opposed to exoteric teaching, was taught in all
the mysteries of the gods.&nbsp; Diana, who is identical with
Vesta, Avesta, or Hestia, as a goddess of light by night and also
of chastity, had her lovers in secret.&nbsp; What further
identifies the two is that in this tale girls who have got into
trouble through love, pray to Vesta, even as Roman maids did
under similar circumstances specially to Diana.</p>
<p>There is no historical proof whatever that the Baptistery was
ever a temple of Vesta, but there is very remarkable
circumstantial evidence to that effect which I have indicated in
detail in an article in the <i>Architectural Review</i>.&nbsp;
Both Vesta and Saint John were each in her or his religion the
special deities or incarnations of Light or Fire, and Purity or
Chastity.&nbsp; The temples of Vesta were like those of Mars, and
Mars alone, either round, hexagonal, or square, to indicate the
form <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>attributed with variations to the world.&nbsp; The
early tradition of all writers on Florence speaks of the
Baptistery of Saint John as having been a temple of Mars, which
legend the priests naturally endeavoured to deny, thinking it
more devout and &ldquo;genteel&rdquo; to attribute its erection
to a Christian Empress.</p>
<p>The binding and rendering impotent by means of a padlock, and
forty other devices, to render married folk miserable, or lovers
languid, was so common two centuries ago, that there is almost a
literature, occult, theological, and legal, on the subject.&nbsp;
The Rabbis say it was invented by Ham, the son of Noah.&nbsp; The
superstition was generally spread in Greece and Rome.&nbsp; It is
still very commonly believed in and practised by witches all over
Europe, and especially by gipsies and the Italian
<i>strege</i>.</p>
<p>What is above all to be remarked in this tale is that it
recognises a double nature in Vesta&mdash;one as a chaste goddess
of fire, the other of a voluptuous or generative deity, signified
by extinguishing the lights.&nbsp; And this is precisely what the
oldest writers declared, though it was quite forgotten in later
times.&nbsp; As Natalis Comes declares, &ldquo;There were
<i>two</i> Vestas, one by the first wife of Saturn, another by
the younger one, meaning the earth, the other fire,&rdquo; as
Ovid witnesses, &ldquo;Fastorum,&rdquo; lib. 6.&nbsp; In fact,
there was a double or second to every one of the Greek or
Etruscan gods.&nbsp; And this belief which was forgotten by the
higher classes remained among the people.&nbsp; And it may be
specially noted that the second Vesta was called the mother of
the gods, as Strabo declares, and she was in fact the Venus of
the primitive or Saturnian mythology.</p>

<p>In the old times, when things were so different from what they
are now&mdash;the blue bluer, the red redder, when the grains of
maize were as big as grapes, and grapes as big as pomegranates,
and pomegranates as big as melons, and the Arno was always full
of water, and the water so full of fine large fish that everybody
had as many as he wanted for nothing, and the sun and moon gave
twice as much light&mdash;there was, not far from Via Reggio, a
castle, and the signore who owned it was a great bandit, who
robbed all the country round, as all the gentlemen did in those
times when they could, for it is true that with all the blessings
of those days they had some curses!</p>
<p>One day there passed by a poor fisherman with an ass, and on
it was a very large, wonderfully fine fish, a tunny, which was a
load for the beast, and which was intended for the good monks of
an abbey hard by, to whom the man hoped to sell it, partly for
money and partly for blessings.&nbsp; When lo! he was met by Il
Bandito, as the signore was called, and, as you may suppose, the
gentleman was not slow to seize the prey, which fell as it were
like a roasted lark from heaven into his mouth.&nbsp; And to mock
the poor fellow, the signore gave him a small bottle of wine to
repay him.</p>
<p>Then the fisherman in his despair cursed the Bandito to his
face, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God forget and the devil remember thee, and as thou
hast mocked my poverty, mayest thou pass centuries in worse
suffering than ever was known to the poorest man on earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt live in groans and lamentations, thou
accursed of God and despised by the devil; thou shalt never have
peace by day or night!</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;Thou shalt be in utter wretchedness till thou
shalt see someone eat this fish.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In pietra cambiato<br />
E in pietra sarai confinata.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thyself a stone, as thou shalt find,<br />
And in a stone thou&rsquo;lt be confined,<br />
And the fish likewise a stone shall be<br />
Till someone shall eat it and set thee free!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as the poor man prophesied, it came to pass: the fish was
changed into a stone, and the signore into a statue.&nbsp; And
the latter stood in a corner of the dining-hall, and every day
the fish was placed at dinner on the table, but no one could eat
it.</p>
<p>So three hundred years passed away, and the lord who had
inherited the castle had a beautiful daughter, who was beloved by
a young signore named Luigi, who was in every way deserving of
her, but whom the father disliked on account of his family.&nbsp;
So when he asked the father for her hand, the latter replied that
he might have it when he should have eaten the stone fish, and
not till then.&nbsp; So the young man went away in grief.</p>
<p>One day, when this young gentleman was returning from the
chase bearing two fine hares, he met Virgilio, who asked him to
sell him one.&nbsp; Whereupon the young man replied: &ldquo;Oh,
take your pick of them, and welcome; but say nothing about
payment.&nbsp; Perhaps some day you may do as much for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Virgilio, &ldquo;that day may
be nearer than you think.&nbsp; I never make my creditors wait,
nor let my debts run into arrears.&nbsp; What is there on earth
which you most desire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly it is something, signore, which I trow that
neither you nor any man can render possible, for it is to eat the
stone fish in the castle up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that it can be managed,&rdquo; replied Virgil,
with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take this silver box full of salt, and
when the fish is before you, sprinkle the salt on it, and it will
grow tender and taste well, and you can eat it.&nbsp; But first
say unto it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Se tu pesce sei fatto<br />
Da un uomo, pel suo atto,<br />
Rimane sempre come sei,<br />
Ma se tu sei scongiurato,<br />
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>O vere
scongiurato,<br />
Non restare pietra&mdash;ritorna come eri.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish, if once a man thou wert,<br />
Then remain e&rsquo;en as thou art!<br />
But if a fish, I here ordain<br />
That thou become a fish again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Luigi went to the castle, and was with much laughter
placed before the fish, and the signore asked him if he would
have a hammer to carve it with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I will eat it after my own fashion,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do but beg permission to use my own salt,
and say my own grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he sprinkled the salt and murmured the incantation, when
the fish became soft and savoury, as if well cooked, and Luigi
ate of it, till the signore of the castle was satisfied, and
admitted that he had fulfilled the conditions&mdash;when lo! the
fish became whole as before, and a stone again.</p>
<p>Then an old statue which was in the hall, in a corner of the
wall, spoke and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am at peace, since the fish has been eaten.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dacche il pesce ha stato
mangiato,<br />
Io non sono pi&ugrave; confinato.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And saying this, there went forth from the image a
spirit-form, which vanished.</p>
<p>Then Luigi wedded the young lady of the castle, and Virgilio,
who was present, promised the pair a happy life.&nbsp; And he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt be, O Luigi, the beginner of a family or race
which, like the Holy Church, will have been founded on a stone,
and while the Church lasts thy name shall endure.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The concluding paragraph refers to <i>pietra</i>, a stone, and
to the text, well known to the most ignorant Catholic,
&ldquo;Petrus es et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam
meam,&rdquo; whence it has been said that the Roman Church was
founded on a pun, to which the reply might be, &ldquo;And what if
it was?&rdquo; since there was no suspicion in early times that
the pun, as a poetical form, might not be seriously employed in
illustration.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson made the silly assertion <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>that a pun
upon a proper name is the lowest kind of wit, in which saying
there is&mdash;as in many of his axioms&mdash;more sound than
sense; nor is it altogether reverent or respectful, when we
reflect that both Christ and Cicero used the despised figure of
speech.&nbsp; In one of the tales in this collection the Emperor
of Rome speaks of a wheat-bran (<i>tisane</i>) which had been
ordered as &ldquo;pigs&rsquo; broth,&rdquo; which was exactly the
term by which Cicero alluded to the Verrine law, which also bears
that meaning.&nbsp; As his adversary was a Jew, and the query
was, &ldquo;What has a Hebrew to do with pig-broth, or
pork-soup?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the law of Verres&mdash;the
joke, with all due deference to the law-giver Samuel, may be
fairly called a very good one. <a name="citation106"></a><a

<h2>VIRGILIO AND THE BRONZE HORSE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The horse of brass.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Milton</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But evermore their moste wonder was<br />
About this hors&eacute;, since it was of brass.<br />
It was of faerie as the peple seemed,<br />
Divers&egrave; folk diversely han deemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>:
<i>The Squiere&rsquo;s Tale</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day Virgilio went to visit the Emperor, and not finding
him in his usual good temper, asked what was the matter, adding
that he hoped it would be in his power to do something to relieve
him.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor complained that what troubled him was that
all his horses seemed to be ill or bewitched, behaving like wild
beasts, or as if evil spirits were in them, and that which
grieved him most was that his favourite white horse was most
afflicted of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not vex yourself for such a thing,&rdquo; replied
Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will cure your horses and all the others
in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he caused to be made a beautiful horse of bronze, <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and it was
so well made that no one, unless by the will of Virgil (<i>senza
il volere di Virgilio</i>), could have made the like.&nbsp; And
whenever a horse which suffered in any way beheld it, the animal
was at once cured.</p>
<p>All the smiths and horse-doctors in Rome were greatly angered
at this, because after Virgil made the bronze horse they had
nothing to do.&nbsp; So they planned to revenge themselves on
him.&nbsp; And they all assembled in a vile place frequented by
thieves and assassins, and there agreed to kill Virgil.&nbsp;
Going to his house by night, they sought for him, but he escaped;
so they, finding the bronze horse, broke it to pieces, and then
fled.</p>
<p>When Virgil returned and found the horse in fragments he was
greatly grieved, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smiths have done this.&nbsp; However, I will yet do
some good with the metal, for I will make from it a bell; and
when the smiths hear it ring, I will give them a peal to remember
me by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the bell was made and given to the Church of San
Martino.&nbsp; And the first time it was tolled it sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Io ero un cavallo di bronzo.<br />
Dai nemici son&rsquo; stato spezzato.<br />
Ma un amico che mi ama,<br />
In campana, mi ha cambiato<br />
E la prima volta che faro<br />
<i>Dindo</i>, <i>dindo</i>! dichiarero<br />
Chi e becco a caprone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a horse of bronze, and tall.<br />
My enemies broke me to pieces small.<br />
But a friend who loves me well<br />
Had me made into a bell.<br />
Now here on high I proudly ring,<br />
And as I <i>dindo</i>! <i>dindo</i> sing,<br />
I tell aloud, as I toll and wave,<br />
Who is a <i>wittol</i> and a knave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And all the smiths who had broken the horse when they heard
the bell became as deaf as posts.&nbsp; Then great remorse came
over them and shame, and they threw themselves down on the ground
before Virgil and begged his pardon.</p>
<p>Virgil replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pardon you; but for a penance you must have six other
bells made to add to this, to make a peal, and put them all in
the same church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did, and then regained their hearing.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>This
same story is told of Virgil in Comparetti&rsquo;s collection;
but the present tale in the original has about it a smack or tone
of the people which is wanting in the older version.&nbsp; Thus,
the song of the bell is a peculiarly quaint conception, and
probably an adaptation of some popular jest to the effect that
bells proclaim the name and shame of certain persons.&nbsp; I
have found that, with rare exception, the legends which I have
given, as preserved by a class to whom tradition has a special
value, are more complete in every respect than the variants drawn
from other sources.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There was once upon a time a grand signore in Florence who had
a clever servant, a young man, who, whether he had a fairy
god-mother or a witch grandmother is not told; but it is certain
that he had such luck at playing ball as to always win and never
lose.&nbsp; And his master so arranged it with him as to bet and
win immense sums.</p>
<p>One day Virgilio, being present at a match in which this <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>young man
played, observed that there sat upon his ball a tiny invisible
goblin, who directed its course as he pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful indeed is thy play,&rdquo; said Virgilio to
the youth, &ldquo;and thy ball&mdash;<i>ha tutta la finezza
dell&rsquo; arte</i>&mdash;hath all the refinement of its art;
but &rsquo;tis a pity that it is not an honest ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art mistaken,&rdquo; replied the young man; but he
reddened as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; answered Virgil, &ldquo;I will show

<i>A carne di lupo dente di cane</i>&mdash;A dog&rsquo;s teeth to
a wolf&rsquo;s hide.&nbsp; My young friend and his old master

<p>There was in Florence the next day a great fair, or
<i>festa</i>, and Virgil, passing where young people were
diverting themselves, saw a very beautiful, bold-faced girl, who
looked like a gipsy, or as if she belonged to some show, playing
ball.&nbsp; Then Virgil, calling a goblin not bigger than a
babe&rsquo;s finger, <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a> bade it go and sit
on the girl&rsquo;s ball, and inhabit and inspire it to
win.&nbsp; It did so, and the girl won every time.&nbsp; Then
Virgilio said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, and I will show you how to win one
hundred crowns.&nbsp; There is a young man who carries all before
him at playing; thou must drive him before thee; <i>e render la
pariglia</i>&mdash;pay him back in his own money.&nbsp; Then
shalt thou have one hundred crowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went together to the castle, and Virgilio said to the
old signore:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found a young girl who plays ball so well, that
I am anxious to try her game against that of your young
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you bet on her?&rdquo; asked the old
signore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand crowns,&rdquo; replied Virgilio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; was the response.</p>
<p>But when they met on the ground the youth and the girl fell in
love at first sight to the last degree, and not being much
troubled with modesty, told one another so&mdash;<i>schiettamente
e senza preamboli</i>&mdash;plainly, without prelude, preamble,
or preface, as is the way and wont of professionals or
show-people, wherein they showed their common sense of the value
of time, which is to them as money.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Then
they began to play, and it was in the old fashion, with two balls
at once, each player tossing one to the other with the drum. <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a>&nbsp; And it came to pass that in the
instant that the two goblins beheld one another from afar they
also fell in love.&nbsp; And as fairies and <i>folletti</i> do
everything, when they will, a thousand times more rapidly than
human beings, and as neither could or would conquer in the game,
they both cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be for ever united in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two balls met with a bump half-way in their course and
fell to the ground as one, while the fays embraced; and at the
same instant the youth and the girl, unable to suppress their
feelings, rushed into one another&rsquo;s arms and began to kiss,
and Virgilio and the old signore roared with laughter, the latter
having a second attack of merriment when Virgilio explained to
him the entire trick and plot.</p>
<p>Then, as it was a drawn game, the thousand crowns were by
common consent bestowed on the young couple, who were married to
their hearts&rsquo; content, having one <i>festa</i> after
another, at which all the guests went from bottle to bottle, even
as the ass of a dealer in pottery goeth from door to door, or as
the pig of Saint Antonio went from house to house.&nbsp;
Amen!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Singularly enough, though this story comes from a witch
source, there is in it no incantation addressed to a ball to make
it always win for its owner; and, oddly enough, I recall one for
that purpose, taken from an American burlesque of &ldquo;Der
Freysch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; <a name="citation110b"></a><a
href="#footnote110b" class="citation">[110b]</a> in which the
demon-hunter calls on Zamiel the fiend to give him a magic
ninepin or skittle-ball.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sammy-hell, a boon I beg!<br />
By thy well and wooden leg!<br />
We ask for that &rsquo;ere bowling ball<br />
Wot&rsquo;ll knock down one and all.<br />
Give us all the queer ingredients,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll remain your most obedients!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>The
idea of enchanted dice which always throw sixes and the like,
forms the subject of stories possibly wherever dice are thrown or
cards played, inasmuch as all gamblers who live or lose by chance
are naturally led to believe that fortune can be invoked or
propitiated.&nbsp; Hence the majority of them carry charms,
fetishes, or amulets.</p>

<p>There were once assembled at the table of the Emperor many
friends of Virgilio, who praised him highly.&nbsp; But there was
also one who abused him bitterly, and called him an ass; and the
word went forth to all the city, and much was said of it, and
there was a great scandal over it.</p>
<p>When Virgil heard of it he smiled, and said that he thought he
would ere long be even with the gentleman who had jackassed him;
and those who knew him were of the same opinion, for certainly
the means of retaliation were not wanting to him.</p>
<p>Now, the Emperor had given to Virgilio an ass to ride, and the
poet said to his patron that, if he would order that the animal
might go or come wherever he pleased, he would show him some time
a merry jest.&nbsp; To which the Emperor right willingly
assented.</p>
<p>So one day there were many lords seated at the imperial table,
and among them were Virgilio and his enemy.&nbsp; But what was
the amazement of all save the magician when the servants, flying
in, said that the ass of the Signore Virgilio had entered the
door, and insisted on coming into the banqueting-hall.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;Admit him instantly,&rdquo; said the
Emperor.</p>
<p>The ass came in as politely as an ass could.&nbsp; He bowed
down before the Emperor and kissed his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has come to visit his dear brother,&rdquo; remarked
the enemy of Virgil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That is true</i>,&rdquo; replied the ass; and
walking up to the gentleman, he stared him in the face, and said:
&ldquo;Good brother, good-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signore, bursting into a rage, tried to utter something,
but only brayed&mdash;and such a bray, the King of the Asses
himself could not have equalled it.&nbsp; There was a roar of
laughter long and loud, revived again with each succeeding
roar.&nbsp; At last, when there was silence, Virgil said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Ciuchino, donkey mine, which of us three
is the <i>real</i> ass?&nbsp; For thy brother there says that I
am one, and thou callest him brother, and yet from thy appearance
I should say that thou art truly &lsquo;the
one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the ass replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust not to looks in this world, for in outward
seeming there is great deceit.&nbsp; By their <i>voice</i> shall
ye know them; by their song, which is the same in all
lands.&nbsp; For many are the languages of mankind, but there is
only one among asses, for we all bray and pray in the same
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; replied Virgilio, &ldquo;thou almost
deservest to become a Christian, and I will help thee to
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saying this, he touched the donkey&rsquo;s nose
with his wand, and his face became as the face of the gentleman,
on whom there now appeared a donkey&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are indeed beginning to look more like
ourselves,&rdquo; quoth the ass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aun-ky&mdash;aunky&mdash;aunky&mdash;ooooh</i>!&rdquo;
brayed the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my lords,&rdquo; explained the donkey,
&ldquo;when translated into <i>volgare</i> from our holy tongue,
is my brother&rsquo;s confession of faith, wherein he declares
that he is the very Ass of Asses&mdash;the <i>summa summarum</i>,
and the <i>somaro dei somari</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; exclaimed Virgilio; and touching
the ass and the signore, he restored to each his natural form and
language.&nbsp; And the signore rushed out in a blind rage, but
the ass went with proper dignity, first saluting the company, and
then bowing low before the Emperor ere he departed.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;<i>Per Bacco</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the Emperor;
&ldquo;the ass, it seems to me, hath better manners and a finer
intellect than his brother.&rdquo;</p>

Imperial Highness, that asses appear to advantage&mdash;even at
court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was once in Florence a wealthy widow lady of noble
family, who had a son who was all that a parent could have
wished, had he not been somewhat reckless and dissipated, and
selfish withal, which he showed by winning the love of girls and
then leaving them; which thing became such a scandal that it
caused great grief to the mother, who was a truly good
woman.&nbsp; And so the youth, who was really a devoted son,
seeing this, reformed his ways for a long time.</p>
<p>But as the proverb says, he who has once drunk at this
fountain will ever remember the taste, and probably drink
again.&nbsp; So it came to pass that in time the young gentleman
fell again into temptation, and then began to tempt, albeit with
greater care and caution&mdash;&rsquo;tis so that all timid
sinners go, resolving the next step shall be the last&mdash;till
finally, under solemn promise of marriage, he led astray into the
very forest of despair a very poor and friendless maid, who was,
however, of exquisite beauty, and known as &ldquo;the girl of
golden locks,&rdquo; from her hair.&nbsp; It might be that the
young man might have kept his word, but at an evil time he was
tempted by the charms of a young lady of great wealth and greater
family, who met him more than half-way, giving him to understand
that her hand was to be had <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>for asking; whereupon he, who never
lost a chance or left a fruit unplucked, asked at once and was
accepted, the wedding-day being at once determined on.</p>
<p>Then the girl with the golden hair, finding herself abandoned,
became well-nigh desperate.&nbsp; Ere long, too, she gave birth
to a child, which was a boy.&nbsp; And it was some months after
this, indeed, ere the wedding of the youth to the heiress was to
take place, when one day, as the young unmarried mother was
passing along the Arno, she met the great poet and sorcerer
Virgil, who saw in her face the signs of such deep suffering, and
of such a refined and noble nature, that he paused and asked her
if she had any cause of affliction.&nbsp; So with little trouble
he induced her to confide in him, saying that she had no hope,
because her betrayer would soon be wedded to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a
tree destined to be felled has escaped the axe and lived till God
blew it down.&nbsp; On the day appointed we three will all go to
the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And truly when the time came all Florence was much amazed to
see the great Virgil going into the Church of Santa Maria with
the beautiful girl with the golden hair and bearing her babe in
his arms.&nbsp; So the building was speedily filled with people
waiting eagerly to witness some strange sight.</p>
<p>And they were not disappointed.&nbsp; For when the bride in
all her beauty and the bridegroom in all his glory came to the
altar and paused, ere the priest spoke Virgil stepped forward,
and presenting the girl with golden locks, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is she whom thou art to wed, having sworn to make
her thy wife, and this is thy child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the infant, who had never before in his life uttered a
word, exclaimed, in loud, sweet tones:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt my father, I&rsquo;m thy
son;<br />
Other father I have none.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there was a great scene, the bride being as one mad, and
all the people crying, &ldquo;<i>Evviva</i>, Virgilio!&nbsp; If
the Signore Cosino <a name="citation114"></a><a
href="#footnote114" class="citation">[114]</a> does not wed the
girl with golden hair, he shall not escape us!&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
he did indeed, and that not so unwillingly, for the sight of the
girl and the authority of <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Virgil, the cries of the people, his
own conscience, and the marvellous occurrence of the babe&rsquo;s
speaking, all reconciled him to it.</p>
<p>So the wedding was carried out forthwith, and every soul in
Florence who could make music went with his instrument that night
and serenaded the newly-married pair.</p>
<p>And the mother was not a little astonished when she saw her
son, who had gone forth with one bride, return with
another.&nbsp; However, she was soon persuaded by Virgil that it
was all for the best, and found in time that she had a perfect
daughter-in-law.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I had rejected this story as not worth translating, since it
presents so few traditional features, when it occurred to me that
it indeed very clearly and rather curiously sets forth Virgil as
a benevolent man and a sympathizer with suffering without regard
to rank or class.&nbsp; This Christian kindness was associated
with his name all through the Middle Ages in literature, and it
is wonderful how the form of it has been preserved unto these our
times among the people.</p>
<p>There is a tale told by one Surius, &ldquo;In Vita S.
Anselmi,&rdquo; cited by Kornmann in his work &ldquo;De Miraculis
Vivorum&rdquo; in 1614, which bears on this which I have
told.&nbsp; A certain dame in Rome not only had a child, <i>ex
incestu</i>, but magnified her sin by swearing the child on the
Pope, Sergius.&nbsp; The question being referred to Saint Anselm,
he asked the babe, which had never spoken, whether his papa was
the Pope.&nbsp; To which the infant answered, &ldquo;Certainly
not,&rdquo; adding that Sergius &ldquo;<i>nihil cum Venere
commercium habere</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Anselmus, as is evident, being
resolved to make a clean sweep of the whole affair and whitewash
the Holy Father to the utmost while he was about it.&nbsp;
Salvert&eacute; would, like a sinner, have said that Anselm was
perhaps a ventriloquist&mdash;<i>es kann sein</i>!</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>But
let us not discuss it, and pass on, just mentioning that since I
wrote the above I found another legend of an Abbot Daniel, of
whom Gregory of Tours and Sophronius relate that he, having
prayed that a certain lady might become a mother, and the request
being complied with, some of Daniel&rsquo;s enemies suggested
that other means as well as prayer, and much more efficacious,
had been resorted to by the saint to obtain the desired
result.&nbsp; But Daniel, inquiring of the babe when it was
twenty-five days of age, was, <i>coram omnibus</i>, fully
acquitted, the <i>bambino</i> pointing to his true father, and
saying, with a nod, &ldquo;<i>Verbis et
mitibus</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> the man!&nbsp; And
the same happened to a Bishop Britius.&nbsp; But Saint Augustine
beats the record by declaring that, &ldquo;It hath sometimes
happened that infants as yet unborn have cried out <i>ex utero
matris</i>&mdash;which is indeed a marvellous thing!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(&ldquo;De Civitate Dei,&rdquo; III., c. 31).</p>
<p>And yet it seems to me that Justinus, Procopius, and several
others, have done as well, if not better; for it is related by
them that a number of orthodox believers who had their tongues
cut out by Socinians, or Unitarians (whom the zealous Dean Hole
declares are all so many little ungodly antichrists, or words to
that effect), went on praying and preaching more volubly than
ever.&nbsp; The same is told by Evagrius of some pious women, but
I do not offer this as a miracle, there being in it nothing
improbable or remarkable.</p>
<p>That the Arians, or Unitarians, or Socinians have set tongues
to wagging&mdash;especially the tongues of flame which play round
the pyres of martyrdom&mdash;is matter of history&mdash;and
breviary.&nbsp; But that they have been the cause of making dead
and tongueless Trinitarians talk, seems doubtful.&nbsp; However,
as the Canadian said <a name="page117"></a><span

knowing what the subtlest form of Antichrist <i>may</i>
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Passons</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dress if you will<br />

</blockquote>
<p>This legend, with several others, was gathered in or near
Arezzo.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the old times people suffered in many things far more than
they now do, firstly from the signori, who treated them worse
than brutes, and as if this were not enough, they were tormented
by witches and wizards and wicked people who went to the devil or
his angels to revenge them on their enemies.&nbsp; However, there
were good and wise men who had the power to conquer these evil
ones, and who did all they could to untie their knots and turn
back their spells and curses on themselves, and the greatest of
these was named Virgilio, who passed all his life in doing
good.</p>
<p>Now, it is an old custom in Arezzo that when men take cattle
to a fair, be it oxen or cows or calves, the animals are tricked
out or ornamented as much as possible, and there is great
competition as to this among the peasants, for it is a great
triumph for a contadino when all the people <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>say that
his beasts made the finest show of any in the place; so that it
is said a man of Arezzo will spend more to bedeck his cattle for
a fair than he will to dress his daughters for a dance.</p>
<p>Now, there was a very worthy, honest man named Gianni, who was
the head or manager under the proprietor of a very fine estate
near Arezzo, and one day he went to the fair to buy a yoke of
oxen.&nbsp; And what he cared for was to get the best, for his
master was rich and generous, and did not much heed the price so
that he really got his money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>But good as Gianni was, he had to suffer the affliction which
none can escape of being envied and hated.&nbsp; For wicked and
spiteful souls find something to hate in people who have not done
them any wrong, and whom they have not the least motive to
harm&mdash;<i>nessunissimo motive</i>.</p>
<p>So the good Gianni found at the fair a pair of oxen which, so
far as ornament was concerned, were a sight to behold.&nbsp; For
they were covered with nets, and adorned with many bands of red
woollen stuff all embroidered with gold, and bearing in gold the
name of their owner, having many cords and tassels and scarfs of
all colours on their heads.&nbsp; And these cords were
elaborately braided, while there hung a mirror on the forehead of
each animal, so that the elegance of their decoration was the
admiration of all who were at the fair.</p>
<p>Then Gianni, seeing the oxen, drew near, but before making an
offer, complimented the owner on their beautiful
appearance.&nbsp; And this done, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very fine, but in doing business for my patron I
set aside all personal friendship.&nbsp; Your cattle are finely
dressed up, but how are the beasts themselves?&nbsp; That is all
that I care to know, and I don&rsquo;t wish to have them turn out
as it happened to a man who married a wife because he admired her
clothes, and found, when she was undressed, that she was a mere
scrap, and looked like a dried cod-fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they talked till the dealer took off the coverings, when
Gianni found, in fact, that the oxen had many faults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say, my friend,&rdquo; quoth Gianni,
&ldquo;that I cannot buy them.&nbsp; I have done you more than
one good turn before now, as you well know, but business is
business, and I am buying for my master, so good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the owner was in a great rage, and grated his teeth, and
swore revenge, for there were many round about who <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>laughed at
him, and he resolved to do evil to Gianni, who, however, thought
no more of it, but went about the fair till he found a pair of
excellent oxen which were the best for sale, and drove them
home.</p>
<p>But as soon as they were in the stable they fell on the ground
(dead).&nbsp; Gianni was in despair, but the master, who had seen
the cattle and found them fine and in good condition when they
arrived, did not blame him.</p>
<p>So the next day Gianni went to another fair, and bought
another yoke of oxen.&nbsp; But when in the evening they were in
the stable, they fell dead at once, as the others had done.&nbsp;
Still the master had such faith in him, that although he was
greatly vexed at the loss, he bade the man go once more to a fair
and try his luck.&nbsp; So he went, and indeed returned with a
magnificent pair, which were carefully examined; but there was
the same result, for they also fell dead as soon as they were
stabled.</p>
<p>Then the master resolved to go and buy cattle for himself, and
did so.&nbsp; But there was the same result: these fell dead like
the others.&nbsp; And the master, in despair and rage, said to
Gianni:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I give thee some money, and now begone, for I
believe that thou bringest evil to me.&nbsp; I have lost four
yoke of oxen, and will lose no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Gianni went forth with his wife and children, in great
suffering.&nbsp; And the master took in his place Dorione.&nbsp;
This was the very man who had owned the oxen which Gianni would
not buy, and he was one who was versed in all the sorcery of
cattle, as such people in the mountains always are, and by his
witchcraft he had brought all this to pass.</p>
<p>But under his care all the cattle flourished wonderfully, and
the master was much pleased with him.&nbsp; But Gianni was in
extreme misery, and could see nothing but beggary before him,
because it was reported everywhere that he brought bad luck, and
he could get no employment.</p>
<p>One day, when matters were at their worst with him and there
was not even a piece of bread in his poor home, he met on the
road a troop of cavaliers, at the head of whom were two
magnificently clad gentlemen, and these were the Emperor and
Virgil.</p>
<p>The poor peasant had stepped aside to admire the procession as
it passed, when all at once Virgil looked with a piercing glance
at Gianni, and cried:</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;Man, what aileth thee that thou seemest so
wretched?&nbsp; For I read in thy face that thou sufferest
unjustly, well-nigh to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gianni told his story, and Virgil answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all of this there is a remedy.&nbsp; Now, come with
me to the house of thy late master, where there is work to be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will drive me out headlong,&rdquo; replied
Gianni; &ldquo;I dare not go.&nbsp; And if I do not return to my
family, who are all ill or starving to death, they will think
that some disaster has befallen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that too there is also a remedy,&rdquo; said
Virgil, with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have no care.&nbsp; Now to thy
master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didst thou send away this honest man?&rdquo; asked
Virgil of the <i>padrone</i>.</p>
<p>To which the master replied by telling all about the
oxen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore, because he brought ruin into my
house did I dismiss him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Virgil, &ldquo;this time thou
didst get rid of an honest man and keep the knave.&nbsp; Now let
us go and see to thy dead oxen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went apace to the spot where the dead oxen had all
been thrown, where the whole eight lay unchanged, for decay had
not come upon them, they were as sound as ever.</p>
<p>Then Virgil exclaimed, as he waved his wand:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If ye are charmed, retake your breath!<br
/>
If you&rsquo;re bewitched, then wake from death!<br />
Speak with a voice, and tell us why,<br />
And who it was that made ye die!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then all the oxen came to life, and sang in chorus with human
voices:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dorione slew us for revenge,<br />
Because Gianni would not buy his oxen,<br />
Truly they were greatly ornamented,<br />
Yet withal were wretched, sorry cattle.<br />
So he swore to be revenged upon him,<br />
So he was revenged by witching us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the whole truth,&rdquo; said Virgil to
the Emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is for you to condemn the
culprit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I condemn him to be at once put to death,&rdquo;
replied the Emperor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hast thou anything to
add?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Virgil; &ldquo;I condemn him to
immediately become a goat after death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dorione was burnt alive for an evil wizard, and he leapt
from the flame in the form of a black goat and vanished.</p>
<p>Gianni returned in favour to his master, and all went well
with him evermore.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The very singular or unusual name of Dorione intimates a
classical origin, and it is true that one of the Danaides, the
bride of Cerceste, was called thus; but on this hook hangs no
analogy.&nbsp; Dordione was the Roman god of blackguardism <i>pur
et simple</i>, unto whom people made obscene
offerings&mdash;which, according to sundry reviewers, might
suggest the Dorian of a certain novel of the ultra
Greek-&aelig;sthetic school, which had many admirers in certain
circles, both in America and England.&nbsp; But it is very
remarkable that wherever it occurs, be it in pagan antiquity or
modern times, the name has always had a certain evil smell about
it, a something fish-like and ancient, but not venerable.&nbsp;
It is true that I have already given a legend of another Dorione,
who was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Virgil; but even this latter
example was sadly given to &ldquo;rapacious
appropriation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Dorians were all a bad lot from a
moral point of view, according to history.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Dorione, who is a mountain shepherd or
herdsman, is noted as a sorcerer.&nbsp; Owing to their solitary
lives and knowledge of secrets in the medical treatment and
management of cattle, this class in many countries (but
especially in France and Italy) is regarded as consisting
entirely of sorcerers.&nbsp; This is specially the case with
smiths, farriers, and all who exercise the veterinary art.</p>
<p>It may also strike the reader as singular that Dorione <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>in the tale
should be moved to such deadly vengeance, simply because Gianni
would not buy his cattle, and preferred others.&nbsp; This is a
very common and marked characteristic of Italians.&nbsp; If you
examine a man&rsquo;s wares, talk about, and especially if you
touch them, you will often be expected to buy as a matter of
course.&nbsp; I have been seriously cautioned in a fair, by one
who was to the manner born, against examining anything unless I
bought it, or something.&nbsp; A few years ago, in Florence, a
flower-girl asked an Englishman to buy of her ware, which he
declined to do, and then changing his mind, bought a bouquet from
another girl close by.&nbsp; Whereupon the first <i>floriste</i>
stabbed and slew the second&mdash;to the great astonishment of
the tourist!</p>
<p>There is an unconscious fitness and propriety in making the
author of the &ldquo;Georgics&rdquo; so familiar with cattle that
he is able to raise them from the dead.&nbsp; The chorus of oxen,
accusing the evil-doer, is an idea or motive which also occurs in
the story of Cain, as given in my &ldquo;Legends of
Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black goat is, and ever was in Italy, specially accursed
as a type of evil.&nbsp; Witches are rarely described as riding
brooms&mdash;their steed is the goat.&nbsp; Evil spirits, or
souls of men accursed, haunt bridges in this form.&nbsp; The
perverse and mischievous spirit of the animal, as well as his
appearance, is sufficient to explain this.</p>

GIRL AND THE FLAGEOLET.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus playing sweetly on the flageolet,<br
/>
He charmed them all; and playing yet again,<br />
Led them away, won by the magic sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>De Pueris Hamle&euml;nsibus</i>,
1400.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is in the Toscana Romagna a place known as La Valle
della Fame, or Valley of Hunger, in which dwelt a family of
peasants, or three brothers and two sisters.&nbsp; The elder
brother had married a wife who was good and beautiful, and she
had given birth to a daughter, but died when the babe was only
one year old.&nbsp; Then, according to the advice of the sisters
and brothers, he married again, that he might have someone to
take care of his child.&nbsp; The second wife was a pretty young
woman, but after she had been wedded a year she gave birth to a
daughter, who was very ugly indeed and evil; but the mother
seemed to love her all the more for this, and began to hate the
elder, who was as good and beautiful as an angel.&nbsp; And as
her hatred grew she beat and abused the poor little girl all day
long.</p>
<p>One morning the latter went into the woods to hide herself
from her stepmother till it should be evening, when she could
return home and be safe with her father and aunts.&nbsp; And
while sitting all alone beneath a tree, she heard a bird above
her singing so sweetly that she felt enchanted.&nbsp; It was a
marvellous sound, at times like the music of a flute played by a
fairy, then like a human voice carolling in soft tones, and then
like a horn echoing far away.&nbsp; The little girl said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, sweet bird, I wish I could pipe and play like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she said this the bird fell from the tree, and when she
picked it up she found that it was a <i>zufolo</i>, or
shepherd&rsquo;s flageolet, in the form of a bird.&nbsp; And when
she blew on it, it gave forth such sweet sounds&mdash;<i>suone
belle da rimanere incantati</i>&mdash;as would charm all who
heard them.&nbsp; And as she practised, she found the art to play
it seemed to come of itself, and every now and then she could
hear a fairy voice in the sound speaking to her.</p>
<p>Now, this was a miracle which had been wrought by <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Virgil the
magician, who did so many wonderful things in the olden time.</p>
<p>In the evening she returned home and played on the bird-pipe,
and all were charmed except the stepmother, who alone heard in
the music a voice which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though sweet thy smile, and smooth thy
brow,<br />
Evil and cold at heart art thou;<br />
I never yet did harm to thee,<br />
Yet thou hast beat me cruelly,<br />
And given me curses fierce and wild<br />
Because I&rsquo;m fairer than thy child.<br />
Unless thou lettest me alone<br />
Henceforth, all ill shall be thine own,<br />
With all the suffering I have known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to the girl the pipe sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sing to thy father, gently say<br />
That thou the morrow goest away,<br />
And tell him thou hast borne too long<br />
Great cruelty and cruel wrong;<br />
For truly he was much to blame<br />
That he so long allowed the same;<br />
But now the evil spell is broken,<br />
The time has come, the word is spoken!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then her father would fain have kept her, but the spell was on
her, and she went out into the wide world playing on her
pipe.&nbsp; And when she was in the woods, the birds and wild
beasts came and listened to her and did as she bade; and when she
was in towns, the people gathered round and were charmed to hear
her play, and gave her money and often jewels, and no one dared
to say an evil word to her, for a spell was on her, and a charm
which kept away evil.</p>
<p>So years passed by, and she was blooming into maidenhood, when
one day a young lord, passing with his mother, who was a woman as
noble of soul and good as her son, paused to hear the girl play
on her pipe and sing, for they thought the marvellous song of the
<i>zufolo</i> was her voice.</p>
<p>Then the lady asked the girl if she would enter a monastery,
where she would be educated and brought up to live in a noble
family in return for her music.&nbsp; The girl replied that she
had already a great deal of money and many jewels, but that she
would be very glad to be better educated and advanced in
life.&nbsp; So she entered the convent, where <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>she was
very happy, and the end thereof was that she became betrothed to
the young signore, and great preparations were made for the
wedding.</p>
<p>Now, the stepmother had but one idea in life, which was that
her own daughter should make some great match, and for this
purpose she was glad when the second went away, as she hoped, to
become a mere vagabond, playing the flute for a living.&nbsp; But
when she heard that the girl was very prosperous in a convent in
Florence, and had not only been educated like a princess in the
best society, but would ere long marry a nobleman, she became mad
with rage; and going to a witch, she paid her a great sum to
prepare a powder which, if strewed in the path of the bride,
would cause her prompt and agonizing pain, and after a time death
in the most dreadful suffering.&nbsp; And this was to be laid in
the way of the wedding procession.&nbsp; But on that morning the
pipe sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er on earth the wind doth
blow,<br />
All leaves and dust before it go.<br />
Evil or good, they fly away<br />
Before its breath, as if in play;<br />
And so shall it for thee this day,<br />
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,<br />
And death to the witch, for so it must<br />
Ever happen as &rsquo;twas decreed,<br />
For death is the pay for an evil deed!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the bridegroom and all friends had begged the bride to
play the flute as she walked in the wedding procession, and she
did so, and it seemed to her that it had never played so
sweetly.&nbsp; The stepmother was looking on anxiously in the
crowd, and when the bride was just coming to the powder in the
way, the wicked woman cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play louder&mdash;<i>louder</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride, to oblige everyone, blew hard, and a wind came from
the pipe which blew all the powder into the stepmother&rsquo;s
eyes and open mouth, and in an instant she gave a cry of agony,
and then rolled on the ground, screaming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il polvore</i>!&nbsp; I have swallowed the
powder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the flute played:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By thy mother I was slain;<br />
A fairy gave me life again.<br />
I was killed for jealousy,<br />
And all as false as false could be.<br />
Now thou art dead and I am free.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>And
from that time the pipe played no more.&nbsp; But the young lady
married the signore, and all went well with them.</p>
<p>And this was done by Virgil, who was ever benevolent.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The pipe, flute, or whistle, which fascinates all who hear it,
is to be found in the traditions of all races, from the story of
Orpheus onward; it even forms the plot of what is one of the
prettiest tales of the Algonkin Indians, <a
name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a> and one which is probably original
with them.&nbsp; What is also common to many is the conception of
the one unjustly put to death turned into a musical instrument,
which by a song betrays the murderer.&nbsp; But what is peculiar
to this story is the power of the pipe to blow away enchantment
and dissipate the witch-dust laid in the path.&nbsp; This is a
very ingenious addition to the conception of the music and
voice.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that sometimes rustic performers on the
pipe, who have chiefly learned their music in the woods from
birds and Nature, sometimes attain to a very fascinating and
singular execution, quite unlike that which is heard from the
most cultivated and artistic musicians.&nbsp; The celebrated Dr.
Justinus Kerner, whom I have heard play, could produce on the
Jew&rsquo;s-harp such results as would be deemed
incredible.&nbsp; It struck me as an extraordinary expression of
will and character beyond all teaching or imitation.</p>
<p>There are also many learned writers on music who are not aware
that the human throat or voice is capable of producing sounds
which are not, so to speak, <i>vocal</i>, but like those of the
musical-box and several wind-instruments.&nbsp; This
accomplishment is common among the blacks of the Southern States,
and the performances, <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>as I can bear witness, are most
extraordinary and amazing.&nbsp; I once mistook the playing of
two coloured boys in Nashville for the sound of a somewhat
distant hand-organ.&nbsp; Even the twang of the banjo is thus
rendered with startling accuracy.&nbsp; It is also true that
reed-pipes can be made which, by combining the voice and blowing
(as with the <i>mirliton</i>), give results which are very little
known, but which probably suggested this and other tales in which
the flute or pipe speaks.&nbsp; There are not many people who
know the bull-roarer save as a boy&rsquo;s toy&mdash;that is to
say, a mere flat bit of wood whirled round at the end of a
cord&mdash;but by modification and combination, this or several
of them produce sounds like those of an organ; and when heard by
night at a distance, the effect is such as to fairly awe those
who are ignorant of its cause.&nbsp; Finally, there is the
application by a tube of air to the &AElig;olian harp, etc., so
as to produce tunes, which is very remarkable, and as little
known as the rest&mdash;albeit, a traveller, who found something
of the kind among the heathen, avowed his belief that something
might be made of it.&nbsp; If people would only find out what
resources they all have within themselves, or in very cheap and
easily-made instruments, there might be far more music or art in
the world than there now is.&nbsp; On which subject the reader
may consult a book, written by me, and entitled &ldquo;The
Cheapest Musical Instruments,&rdquo; etc., now being published by

BEGHINA DI AREZZO, OR VIRGIL AND THE SORCERESS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>Beauty, when blent with wickedness,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er yet did faile to bring distresse,<br />
A lovely thing that is an evil<br />
Is the own daughter of the devil;<br />
And what was wicked from the first<br />
Unto the ende will be accurst,<br />
And sow, I trow, full sinfull seede,<br />
As ye may in this story reade!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was in Arezzo a young woman of rare
beauty, though of base condition.&nbsp; This girl showed from her
earliest years a very strong character, great and varied talents
or gifts, and the outward appearance, at least, of great piety
and morality, so that she was always in church or absorbed in
thought, which passed for pious meditation, while she never
missed early Mass on a single morning.</p>
<p>It came to pass that a young gentleman who was rich, handsome,
clever, and of good family, fell in love with her and offered
marriage, but this she refused, to the amazement of all,
especially her parents.&nbsp; But the girl declared that her
disposition to religion made marriage objectionable to her; and
indeed at this time she so devoted herself to devotion that she
hardly found time to eat.&nbsp; Yet as she did not become a nun,
the Aretini, or people of Arezzo, called her the Beghina
(Beguine), or Sister of Charity.&nbsp; Yet in doing all this she
had ideas of her own, or more fish in her net than the world was
aware of, for the peasants for her services and prayers,
regarding her as a saint who could work miracles, because she
indeed effected many strange things which seemed to them to be
Divine, brought her many gifts, including money, all of which she
declared would be devoted in future to the Madonna, regarding all
which she had a great work in view.</p>
<p>At last her reputation for sanctity spread over all the
country, and it was greatly increased when it was reported that
so poor a girl had refused to marry a rich young gentleman, so
that she was visited by the nobility, among whom she acquired
great influence.&nbsp; And as she declared that it <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>was her
ambition to build a small church, and with it a home for herself,
they, hoping that this would bring many pilgrims and greatly
benefit the town, at last offered her thirty thousand crowns
wherewith to carry out her pious purposes, which she with thanks
and tears gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>The first thing which she did, however, was to build for
herself a house, for which there was (secretly) constructed a
long subterranean passage which led out to the river.&nbsp; Then
she left her parents, saying that for the present she must lead a
life of devotion in absolute seclusion.&nbsp; Then it was
observed that from time to time young gentlemen were missing, and
more than once their bodies were found floating in the river
below the house of La Beghina, yet so great was her reputation
for sanctity that no one connected their loss with her name.</p>
<p>So years passed by.&nbsp; But there was one who put no faith
in her piety, and this was the signore whom she had refused, and
with whom love for her had been succeeded by a bitter love of
revenge, and by constant observation and inquiry he found out
several things which greatly confirmed his suspicions.&nbsp; The
first of these was the discovery of the bodies in the river; and
being resolved to find out all the secrets of her house, he
visited the mason who had built it, saying that he wished to
erect a mansion for himself, and as he greatly admired that of La
Beghina, would like to have one exactly like it.&nbsp; To which
the old man replied that he was willing, but as every person who
built a house kept certain details a secret to secure the safety
of persons or property in certain emergencies, he must be excused
if he withheld certain particulars.&nbsp; But the young signore
replied that he had set his heart on having just such a house in
every respect; that he himself wished to conceal all secrets,
and, finally, that he would pay a round sum extra to have his
desire fulfilled.&nbsp; This was an argument which the mason
could not resist, and so explained to his patron every detail of
the building, which made more than one mystery clear to
him.&nbsp; And having learned the secret of the underground
passage which led to the river, he began to watch it by night
with great care; and found that the exit by the river was by a
stone door, which was so artfully concealed in a rock by bushes
that it was hardly perceptible.</p>
<p>One night, when it was very dark, the Signore Primo, <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>for such
was his name, being on the watch, heard a noise and saw the door
open.&nbsp; Then there appeared the Beghina, bearing or dragging
a long package or bundle&mdash;<i>un involto</i>&mdash;which she
let fall into the flood.&nbsp; And at this sight the signore
could not restrain a cry of rage, understanding it all, whereat
La Beghina fled in terror into the passage, leaving the door
unfastened behind her.&nbsp; But the young man, unheeding her,
cast himself headlong into the river after the bundle, which he
succeeded in bringing to land, and on opening it found the body
of a young gentleman of his acquaintance, who was not, however,
quite dead, as he had been merely heavily drugged, and who with
care was restored to life.&nbsp; And truly he had a strange tale
to tell, how he had been inveigled mysteriously and blindfolded,
and introduced to some unknown house where there was a handsome
woman, who, after he had made love with her, drugged and robbed
him, after which he became unconscious.</p>
<p>The Signore Primo conveyed his friend to his own home, and
after caring for his comfort and earnestly recommending him to
keep the whole matter a secret, went back to the stone door, and
finding it open, and having already learned how the house was
built, he entered, and concealed himself where he could watch the
mistress.</p>
<p>Early in the morning there came an elderly lady, who with many
tears and in great emotion told the Beghina that she had a son
gone to the war, and was in great fear lest he should be slain,
and that she had prayed to the Virgin that he might return safe
and sound; and that if the Beghina by her piety would bring this
to pass, she would at once give her fifty gold crowns, and a very
much larger sum in case her son should come to her again soon and
well.&nbsp; To which La Beghina replied that she could go home
with a happy heart, for in a few days she should have her son
with her.&nbsp; So the lady departed.</p>
<p>Then the Beghina went into a secret room [but the Signore
Primo continued to follow and observe her] and taking a pack of
cards and a chain, she threw them against the wall and beat on
the ground, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Diavoli tutti che siete nell&rsquo;
inferno!<br />
Scatenatevi, e damme portatevi,<br />
Un comando<br />
Vi voglio dare<br />
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Fino
alla citt&aacute;<br />
Dov&rsquo;&eacute; la guerra dovete andare,<br />
E salvare<br />
Il figlio della signora;<br />
Che pochanzi damme e venuta<br />
E portatelo subito a casa sua,<br />
In carne anima ed ossa,<br />
Se questa grazia mi farete<br />
L&rsquo;anima di quel giovane l&rsquo;avrete!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ye devils who are in hell,<br />
Loosen your chains, and come at once to me!<br />
I give you a command&mdash;<br />
Go to the city where the war is waged,<br />
And save the life of the son<br />
Of the lady who came to me of late,<br />
And bear him quickly to her in her home!<br />
Bear him in flesh, soul and bones!<br />
If ye do me this favour,<br />
Ye shall have the soul of that youth!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when this was sung many devils appeared and saluted her as
a queen.</p>
<p>The Signore Primo was indeed amazed and terrified, for now he
realized that the Beghina was worse than he had supposed, or a
witch of the most malignant kind.&nbsp; But he left the place,
and going to the lady, told her all he had witnessed.&nbsp; Then
she in great terror fainted, and when restored to life declared
that, if anyone could save the soul of her son, he should have
all her fortune.</p>
<p>Then the Signore Primo told her that if anyone could defeat
the evil witch it was a great magician who by lucky chance was in
Arezzo, and that she should seek him forthwith.&nbsp; This great
magician was no other than Virgil.&nbsp; And as soon as the lady
appeared, Virgil said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why thou art come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he led her to the form of an angel clad in a
rose-coloured garb, and, kneeling before it, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O tu angelo del paradiso!<br />
Ma benche puro e innocente sei stato<br />
In questa terra confinata<br />
Per salvare tua madre de suoi peccati,<br />
Ma anche nel altro mondo<br />
Ne fa sempre di peggio,<br />
E per questo sarai liberato te<br />
E confinata nel tuo posto,<br />
La compagna e complice<br />
Di tua madre la Beghina<br />
La Beghina di Arezzo.<br />
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Vai tu
angelo beato!<br />
Da l&rsquo;angelo custode!<br />
E dilli che invochi<br />
Lo spirito che di la ha piu comando,<br />
E potenza di volere salvare<br />
L&rsquo;anima di quel giovane,<br />
Che la Beghina le ha venduta<br />
E cosi tu tu sarai in pace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou angel of Paradise!<br />
Yet who, though pure and ever innocent,<br />
Hast been enchanted on this earth<br />
(Confined in the form which thou wearest),<br />
To save thy mother for her sins;<br />
Yet even in another world<br />
She will ever be worse.<br />
Therefore thou shalt now be freed,<br />
And thy mother and her accomplice<br />
Be enchanted in thy place.<br />
The Beghina of Arezzo,<br />
Go, thou blessed angel,<br />
To the angel who guards thee!<br />
Bid him invoke the spirit who has most power<br />
To save the soul of that youth<br />
Whom the Beghina has sold;<br />
Thus shalt thou be in peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that instant there was heard a clap of thunder, the sound
of a roaring storm, and there fell down before them two human
beings like two corpses, yet not dead, and these were La Beghina
and her companion witch.</p>
<p>Then there entered a grand sun-ray, which flashed in light
upon the angel whom Virgil had summoned.&nbsp; And it said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth is saved, and whoever doeth good shall find
good even in another world.&nbsp; Farewell; I too am
saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Beghina and her companion began to spit fire and
flame, and they were condemned to wander for ever, without
resting, from one town to another, ever possessed with a mad
desire to do evil, but without the ability, for Virgil had taken
the power from them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This story seemed to me in the original, after more than one
reading, so confused and high-flown, that I was on the point of
rejecting it, when a friend who had also perused it persuaded me
that, under all its dialectic mis-spellings, barbarous divisions
of words, <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>and manifest omissions (as, for instance, what became
of the Sieur Buridan of the Italian Tour de Nesle, who was so
nearly drowned), there was a legend which was manifestly the
mangled version of a far better original.&nbsp; Therefore I have
translated it very faithfully, and would specify that there was
from me no suggestion or hint of any kind, but that it is
entirely of the people.</p>
<p>Firstly, it may be observed that the long-continued,
deliberately-contrived hypocrisy of the Beghina, as well as the
Red Indian-like vindictiveness of the hero, is perfectly Italian
or natural.&nbsp; The construction of secret passages and
hiding-places in buildings is almost common even to-day.&nbsp;
The idea of a holy spirit who undergoes a penance,
<i>confinata</i>, or enchanted and imprisoned in a statue to
redeem her mother, is also finely conceived, as is the final
statement that the Beghina and her mysterious accomplice, who is
so abruptly introduced, are condemned to wander for ever,
tormented with a desire to do evil which they are unable to
satisfy.</p>
<p>The Beghina is an incarnation of hypocrisy, deceit, lust and
treachery.&nbsp; The four symbols for these were the serpent,
wren, chameleon, and goose&mdash;the latter because a certain
Athenian named Lampon was wont to swear &ldquo;by the
goose!&rdquo; and then break his oath.&nbsp; Possibly the origin
of the saying &ldquo;He is sound upon the goose&rdquo; is derived
from this.</p>
<p>But I sometimes think that to decide between tradition or
borrowing and independent creation is beyond the folklore of the
present day.</p>

SPIRIT OF THE SNOW OF COLLE ALTO. <a name="citation134"></a><a

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And hence, O virgin mother mild,<br />
Though plenteous flowers around thee blow,<br />
Not only from the dreary strife<br />
Of winter, but the storms of life,<br />
Thee have thy votaries aptly styled<br />
Our Lady of the Snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>: <i>Tour on the
Continent</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once in the olden time, in Colle Alto, the snow fell in one
night many yards in depth, and the people were astonished and
frightened when they awoke in the morning at beholding it
spreading far and wide.&nbsp; Many tried to shovel it away, but
were discouraged, because, as they removed it, as much came in
its place, so that at last they all remained at home, for no one
could pass through the snow, and they were afraid of being buried
in it.</p>
<p>But the poor, who had but scant provision in their homes,
suffered from hunger.&nbsp; And among these was a good man to
whom his five children pitifully cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Babbo-il pane</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Papa, give us
bread!</p>
<p>And he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children weep, and I must risk my life to save
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And looking out, he cried unthinkingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And yet the snow is very beautiful!<br />
O Spirit of the Snow&mdash;no mortal knows<br />
How beautiful thou art.&nbsp; Be kind to us!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he said this there appeared before the window, and then
among them, a lady of marvellous beauty and dazzling brightness,
all clad in white, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wilt thou have, since thou hast invoked
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; replied the astonished peasant, &ldquo;I
know not who thou art, nor did I call thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in thy speech thou didst pronounce my name in
invocation, and to those who do that, and deserve it, I give my
aid.&nbsp; Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>The
poor man was surprised and bewildered, but he followed, while
trembling, the lady.</p>
<p>And she spoke in a voice which was heard in every house far
and near in Colle Alto:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him who will come forth without fear, for this good
man hath opened unto you the way.&nbsp; But it is only the poor
who can do this, because, while they have suffered and starved in
their homes, not one of the rich who dwell here have made any
effort to relieve the suffering, therefore none of them shall
come forth till the snow is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the poor folk found that they could walk upon the
snow, <a name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> which was a pleasure, but the
gentlefolk could not stir a step out of doors till it
melted.&nbsp; And it vexed them sorely to stand at their windows
and see women and children running merrily over the snow, so that
some of them cursed their wealth, and wished that they were of
the poor and free.</p>
<p>For fifteen days not a flake of snow disappeared, and then all
at once it went away, and the poor, on opening their windows in
the morning, found the sun shining, and a warm breeze blowing,
which was scented as with roses, and the streets and roofs all as
clean as if new.&nbsp; Then all the poor gathered every man a
stone, and meeting in one place, they there built a little church
(<i>chiesina</i>), and called it the Chapel of the Goddess of the
Snow, and adored her as if she had been the Madonna or a
saint.</p>
<p>Then for some time, as usually happens, there was great
enthusiasm&mdash;<i>vie un gran fanatismo</i>&mdash;and then
again all was gradually forgotten.&nbsp; So with the Goddess of
the Snow: as years went by people talked about her less and less,
and she was even ridiculed by those who were of evil hearts and
souls, such as abuse and ill-treat their benefactors&mdash;as was
shown by a certain waggoner, who found himself one day many miles
afar from any house, when snow began to fall.&nbsp; And with it
he began to curse, so as to shock even a sinner; whereupon it
drifted round him so deeply that he with his waggon could get no
further.&nbsp; And so he kept on blaspheming.&nbsp; His poor
starved horses looked at him with meaning, as if calling his
attention, and then cast their glances to the wall or a shrine,
whereon was depicted an image of the Goddess of the Snow, as if
begging him to <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>notice or to appeal to it.&nbsp; And the wretch
beholding it, swore worse than ever, saying that she was an
accursed (witch).</p>
<p>He had not time to pronounce the word ere he sank down (into
the snow), so that only his head remained uncovered.&nbsp; And
his horses also were in the same place, but a warm wind began to
blow.&nbsp; And so the man remained fast, freezing and starving,
for three days, but it did not make him repent, and he swore more
than ever.</p>
<p>Then, on the third day, Virgil, the great magician, passed by,
and was amazed at seeing the horses quietly feeding on grass in
the warm sunshine, while a pleasant breeze was blowing, and close
by them a man buried to his neck in the snow.&nbsp; And being
questioned, the waggoner replied that he was thus buried for
blaspheming the Goddess of the Snow.</p>
<p>Virgil asked him if he repented it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will repent,&rdquo; replied the waggoner, &ldquo;when
I see it proved by a miracle&mdash;but in miracles I put no
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Virgil, &ldquo;pray to the goddess to
pardon you.&nbsp; Pray with me thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dea della neve che sei candida,<br
/>
E pura la sera a lume di Luna,<br />
Un bel lenzuola candida sembra<br />
Distesa sulla terra e sui tetti:<br />
Col sol sei splendida e rilucente:<br />
E vero ti sprezzai, ma non fu io<br />
Fu il diavolo che mia ha tentato.<br />
E spero da oggi non mi tentera pi&ugrave;,<br />
Perche amo essere in grazia tua e come,<br />
Stella tu sei bella, sei bianca,<br />
Sei candida e pura e sei l&rsquo;unica<br />
Che fra le Dee non faccia altro<br />
Che bene, e mai male, bella dea!<br />
O dea della Neve tu che sei<br />
L&rsquo;unico mio pensiero, unica speme,<br />
Unica mia speranza&mdash;da ora avanti,<br />
Tutti e tutti miei pensieri<br />
Saranna a te rivolti&mdash;neppur da casa<br />
Mi partero prima di fare a te<br />
Una preghiera che possa spiegar<br />
Il mio pensier al dar farsi<br />
Partir o restar a te domandero,<br />
A te domandero che devo far.<br />
Tutto questo a te rivago<br />
E sempre rivolgero se tu mi perdonerai<br />
E questa grazia mi farai<br />
Che son pentito assai<br />
Di farmi sortir di qui<br />
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Che
tanto sofro&mdash;farmi sortir&mdash;<br />
Sano e salvo che io posso tornar<br />
In braccio alla mia famiglia!<br />
Che da tre sere mi chiamami desidera!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Goddess of the Snow, who art so white<br />
And pure that in the evening, in the light<br />
Of the full moon, thou seem&rsquo;st to be<br />
A fair bright sheet spread over earth and roofs<br />
(That all may sleep beneath it and in peace),<br />
But who art splendid with a ruddy glow<br />
In the using sunlight&mdash;it is very true<br />
That I did scorn thee, yet it was not I.<br />
For &rsquo;twas the devil in truth who tempted me,<br />
And who, I hope, will never tempt me more,<br />
Because I fain would be in thy good grace!<br />
O Star, thou art most beautiful and white,<br />
Candid and pure, because thou truly art<br />
Among the goddesses the only one<br />
Who only doest good, and by no chance<br />
Art sullied with aught evil&mdash;O most fair!<br />
O Goddess of the Snow, who art indeed<br />
My only thought, my only hope in life,<br />
My only trust from now till ever on!<br />
My all and every thought shall turn to thee<br />
Nor will I ever from my house depart<br />
Till I have offered thee a fervent prayer,<br />
In which I&rsquo;ll lay before thee all my soul,<br />
And ask of thee what &rsquo;tis that I must do,<br />
And if I must remain or mend my way!<br />
All this do I repeat to thee again,<br />
And ever will repeat if thou wilt but<br />
Pardon my sin and grant to me the grace,<br />
Having repented from my very heart,<br />
To draw me from this place of suffering,<br />
That safe and sound I may return again<br />
Unto the embraces of my family,<br />
Who for three nights have called to me in vain!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had hardly ended this invocation before a voice
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alzati e cammina e porta con te<br />
Anche i tuoi animali ma non bestemmiare<br />
Mai pi&ugrave;, perche questaltra voltra<br />
Sprafonderesti nell&rsquo; abisso dove<br />
Gnenti (niente) pi&ugrave; bastarrebbe per levarti<br />
Dall&rsquo; inferno.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise and depart, and take away with thee<br />
Thy beasts in peace, but never more blaspheme,<br />
Because another time thou&rsquo;lt sink so deep<br />
To the abyss that nothing will avail<br />
To draw thee out, for thou wilt fall to hell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Then
the waggoner took his horses and rode home at double-quick
speed.&nbsp; He related to all what had happened, and the chapel
was again restored with the image of the goddess.&nbsp; But even
among the experienced (<i>conoscenti</i>) none could tell him
[for a long time] who was the one who had taught him what to
do.&nbsp; But it was at last made known to them that it was the
great magician and the great poet Virgil, because the Goddess of
the Snow and Virgil are good spirits. <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a></p>
<p>So this waggoner, from being evil became so good that one
could not find his equal.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Our Lady of the Snow, or Maria vom Schnee, is one of the more
familiar avatars of the Madonna all over Middle and Northern
Italy and Germany, including Austria and Switzerland.&nbsp; One
of the commonest halfpenny or <i>soldo</i> pamphlets sold at
corners in Florence is devoted to her.&nbsp; A very famous
Madonna of the Snow is that of Laveno, to whom there is a special
festival.&nbsp; Wordsworth has devoted a poem to her.</p>
<p>In the legend which I have given the general resemblance of
the whole to the Madonna tales, as in the building a chapel, the
threat of hell, and the punishment for profanity, suggest that it
is borrowed from a Catholic source.&nbsp; This I doubt, for
several reasons.&nbsp; It is of the witch witchy, and heathen, as
shown by calling the lady a goddess, and especially by the long
<i>scongiurazione</i> or evocations in which the sorcerer takes
such delight that for him they form the solid portion of the
whole, possibly because they are, if not actually prohibited, at
least secret things, cryptic or of esoteric lore.&nbsp; Now, be
it noted that wherever, as regards other legends, as in that of
the Madonna del Fuoco, given in my &ldquo;Etrusco-Roman
Legends,&rdquo; the witch claims that her tradition has been
borrowed by the priests, <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>she is probably in the right.&nbsp;
But what gives colour to the opinion that this Madonna is of
heathen origin is the fact that in the Old German mythology, as
Friedrich declares, there is a deity known as Lady Holde, Holle,
or Hilda (who may be again found in the Christian Maria), who is
a kind and friendly being.&nbsp; She was the Goddess of the Snow,
hence it is commonly said when it snows that Lady Holde is making
her bed and shaking out the feathers.&nbsp; As there is no German
supernatural character, especially in the fairy mythology, which
does not exist in Northern Italy, it would be very remarkable
indeed if such a widely known and popular spirit as the Lady of
the Snow had not been known there long before the Christian
Madonna.&nbsp; I would add that this is purely and literally a
legend of the people, not asked for by me, and not the result of
any inquiry or suggestion.</p>
<p>The Madonna della Neve is especially honoured at Laveno, where
there is an annual procession in her honour.&nbsp; I am indebted
to the kindness of the Rev. Arthur Mangles, who knew that I was
interested in the subject, for the following, translated by him
from some small local book there published:</p>
<h2>THE LEGEND OF LA MADONNA DELLA NEVE.</h2>
<p>In the fourth century there lived in Rome two devout people,
husband and wife, who, having no children, prayed to the Virgin
that she would indicate to them the best way in which to leave
their money.</p>
<p>On the night of the fifth of August, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 352, the Virgin appeared to them and
told them to build a church upon the summit of the Esquiline
Hill, in Rome, exactly upon the area then covered with snow.</p>
<p>The Pope had the same vision of the Virgin, with the same
communication as that of the husband and wife.&nbsp; <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Therefore
he sent to the place indicated a messenger, accompanied by many
priests, who found the snow.</p>
<p>The husband and wife forthwith built a handsome church upon
the spot.</p>
<p>The church, which is now on the same hill, and on the
foundation of the early edifice, is that of Santa Maria
Maggiore.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Snow in August is rather a thin miracle whereon to found a
legend, or a church, but it may pass.&nbsp; The one which I have
translated seems to me to have a greater air of antiquity, with
its retribution and beautiful Latin-like invocation to the Spirit
of the Snow.</p>
<h2>THE MAGICIAN VIRGIL; A LEGEND FROM THE SABINE.</h2>
<p>The following tale was obtained by Miss Roma Lister from the
vicinity of Rome, and from an old woman who is learned in sorcery
and incantations.&nbsp; It begins with the note that, on February
8, 1897, it was taken down as given, literally word for word, and
I translate it accordingly verbatim.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There were a husband, a wizard, and his wife (who was a
witch), who had a beautiful daughter, and a house with a fine
garden which was full of broccoli&mdash;oh, the finest broccoli
in the world!</p>
<p>And opposite to this, or overlooking the garden, dwelt two
women, and one of these was <i>incinta</i>, or with child, and
she said to the other woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Comare</i>, <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a> how I would like
to have two broccoli from the magician&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re so nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>comare</i>, but how to get them?&nbsp; It would
be dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;<i>La cosa si far&agrave;</i>&mdash;it can be
done, at midnight when the sorcerer is asleep, by stealing a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they did, for at midnight both went with a sack,
climbed over the iron gate, and, having filled their bag, went
away. <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a"
class="citation">[141a]</a></p>
<p>In the morning the magician Virgilio went to his garden and
found that many broccoli were gone.&nbsp; In a rage he ran to his
wife, and said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied: &ldquo;This night we&rsquo;ll set the cat on
guard upon the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was done.&nbsp; That evening, <i>fra il lusco e il
brusco</i>, <a name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b"
class="citation">[141b]</a> the one said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, gossip, this night it can&rsquo;t be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&nbsp; Because they&rsquo;ve set a
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard!&nbsp; An old cat, you mean.&nbsp; Are you afraid
of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because she mews when she sees
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&nbsp; Take a bit
of meat, and when she opens her mouth to mew, pitch it in.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll keep her jaws quiet while we pick the
broccoli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was done, and they got away with another bagful of
broccoli.</p>
<p>In the morning the <i>mago</i> Virgil found that he had been
robbed again.&nbsp; He complained again to his wife, who
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to-night we will put the dog on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said and done.&nbsp; But the dame at the window was on the
watch.&nbsp; And seeing all, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No broccoli to-night, gossip.&nbsp; This time
they&rsquo;ve put the dog to look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the dog!&nbsp; When he opens <i>his</i> jaws
to bark, I&rsquo;ll pitch in a good bit of hard cheese.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll keep him quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said and done again.&nbsp; The next morning the magician found
a still greater disappearance of broccoli from his garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is becoming serious,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-night I will watch myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went to his gate and remained there, looking
closely at all those who passed by.&nbsp; So he said to the
first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass on,&rdquo; replied the magician.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the man I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass on&mdash;<i>non fate per me</i>&rdquo; (you
won&rsquo;t do).</p>
<p>There came a baker.&nbsp; He was not wanted.&nbsp; But the
next was a digger of ditches and of graves&mdash;a
<i>fossaruolo</i>&mdash;and the wizard cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re my man!&nbsp; Come with me; I
want you to dig a pit in my garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the poor man went, for he was as much frightened at the
terrible face and stature of the wizard as he was in hope of
being paid.&nbsp; And being directed, he dug a hole nearly as
deep as the magician was tall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;get some light
sticks and cover over the pit while I stand in it, and then strew
some twigs and leaves over it, with a few leaves to hide the top
of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done, and there he stood covered.&nbsp; The ditcher, or
sexton, hurried away, glad that he had dug this strange grave for
another, and not for himself.</p>
<p>Evening came, and the gossip looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; There is not even a dog on guard.&nbsp;
Come, let us hurry!&nbsp; This time we will take all that remains
of the broccoli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said and done.&nbsp; And when they had gathered the last
plant, the gossip cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what beautiful mushrooms!&nbsp; Let us pick
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had seen the two ears of the sorcerer, which peeped out
uncovered.&nbsp; So she took hold of one and pulled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not come out!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
thou pull at one, while I draw at this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each pulled, when the magician raised his awful face and
glared at them.&nbsp; <i>E sorte fuori la terribile testa del
mago</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall die for robbing me!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>They were in a fine fright.&nbsp; At last Virgil said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will spare thy life, if thou wilt give me all thou
bearest&mdash;all within thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She consented, and they departed.&nbsp; After a time she
became a mother, and the magician came and demanded the
child.&nbsp; And as she had promised it, she consented to <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>give it to
him, but begged that it might be left to her for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give it to thee for seven years,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; Saying this, he left her in peace for a long
time.&nbsp; So the child, which was a boy, was born, and as he
grew older was sent every day to school.</p>
<p>One morning the magician met him, and said: &ldquo;Tell thy
mother to remember her promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he gave the
child some sweets, and left him.&nbsp; When at home the boy
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, a gentleman met me to-day at the door of the
school, and said to me that I should tell you to remember your
promise.&nbsp; Then he gave me some comfits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor mother was in a great fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, when you next meet him,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;that you forgot to give his message to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the boy met the magician, and said to him that he
had forgotten all about it, and told his mother nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, tell her this evening, and be sure to
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother heard this, and bade him tell the sorcerer the same
thing again.</p>
<p>When he met the magician Virgil again and told the same story,
the latter smiled, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that thou hast a bad memory.&nbsp; This time I
will give thee something by which to remember me.&nbsp; Give me
thy hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy gave his hand; the magician bit into one finger, and
as the child screamed, he said: &ldquo;This time thou wilt
remember.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy ran yelling home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what has happened to me, <i>brutta
mammacia</i>&mdash;you naughty mamma&mdash;because I did what you
bade, and told the gentleman that I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor woman, hearing herself called <i>brutta mammacia</i>,
<a name="citation143"></a><a href="#footnote143"
class="citation">[143]</a> was overcome with grief and shame, and
said, &ldquo;<i>Vai bene</i>&mdash;I will tell him
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the next day she took the child and gave
him to the magician, who led him to his home.</p>
<p>But when his wife, the witch, beheld the boy, she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill that child at once, for I read it in his face that
he will be the ruin of our daughter Marietta!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>But
the magician declared that nothing would induce him to harm the
boy, so the little fellow remained, and was treated by the master
like a son.&nbsp; In due time he became a tall and handsome young
man, and he was called Antonuccio.&nbsp; But the witch always
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should kill and eat him, for he will be the ruin of
our Marietta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the magician, weary of her complaints, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bene</i>!&nbsp; I will set him a task, and if he
cannot accomplish it, that same night shall he be
slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Antonuccio, as he slept in the next room, had overheard
all this.</p>
<p>The next morning the magician took the youth to a stable which
was very large and horribly filthy, such as no one had ever seen,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Antonuccio, you must clean this stable out and
out&mdash;<i>bene e bene</i>&mdash;repave it on the ground, and
whitewash all above it; and moreover, when I speak, an echo shall
answer me.&rdquo; <a name="citation144"></a><a
href="#footnote144" class="citation">[144]</a></p>
<p>The poor youth went to work, but soon found that he could do
next to nothing.&nbsp; So he sat down in despair.</p>
<p>At noon came Marietta, to bring him his lunch, and found him
in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Antonuccio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew that I am to be killed this
evening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father has said that unless I clean out the
stable, and pave and whitewash it to the echo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&nbsp; <i>Sta allegro</i>&mdash;be of good
cheer&mdash;I&rsquo;ll attend to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marietta went home, and stealing in on tip-toe while the
sorcerer slept, softly carried away his magic wand, and with a
few words cleaned out the stable to the echo, and Antonuccio was
delighted.</p>
<p>In the evening the magician came, and finding the stable clean
as a new pin, was much pleased, and kissed him and took him
home.&nbsp; The witch-wife was furious at learning that the
stable had been cleaned, and declared that Marietta had done it,
and ended by screaming for his life.&nbsp; At last the wizard
said:</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;To-morrow I will set him another task, and
should he fail in that, he shall surely die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning he led the youth into a dense forest of
mighty trees, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou seest this wood?&nbsp; In one day it must be all
cut down and cleared away to a clean field, in which must be
growing all kinds of plants which are to be found in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Antonuccio began to hew with an axe, and worked well, but
soon gave up the task in despair.</p>
<p>At noon came Marietta with her basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, crying again!&nbsp; What is the trouble
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to clear away all this forest, make a clean field,
and plant it with all the herbs in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, eat your lunch, and I will see about
it.&nbsp; It is lucky that it is not something
difficult!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran home, got a magic wand, and went to work.&nbsp; Down
the trees came crashing&mdash;away they flew!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a
fine sight, upon my word!&nbsp; And then up sprouted all kinds of
herbs and flowers, till there was the finest garden in the
world.</p>
<p>In the evening came the magician, and was well pleased at
finding how well Antonuccio had done the work.&nbsp; But when his
wife heard all, she raged more than ever, declaring that it had
all been done by Marietta, who was destined to be ruined by the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; exclaimed the wizard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you will give me no peace, I must put an end to this
trouble.&nbsp; I will give the boy nothing to do
to-morrow&mdash;he may remain idle&mdash;and in the evening I
will chop off his head with this axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antonuccio heard this speech as he had done the others, and
this time was in despair.&nbsp; In the morning Marietta found him
weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Antonuccio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to do no work to-day, but this evening I am to
have my head chopped off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&nbsp; Be of good cheer&mdash;<i>sta
allegro</i>&mdash;I will see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the pot on the fire to boil, and began to make the
macaroni.&nbsp; When she had cooked a great deal, they fed all
the furniture, pots and pans, chairs and tables, to please them,
and induce them to be silent&mdash;all except the hearth-brush,
whom by oversight they forgot.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Marietta, &ldquo;we must be
off and away; it is time for us to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away they ran.&nbsp; After a while the wizard and his wife
returned and knocked at the door.&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; They
rapped and called, but got no reply.&nbsp; At last the
hearth-brush cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marietta, open the door&mdash;it is I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Marietta.&nbsp; She has run away with
Antonuccio.&nbsp; First they fed everybody with ever so much
macaroni, but gave me none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the witch cried to the wizard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry&mdash;hasten&mdash;catch them if you
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man did as he was bid, and began to
travel&mdash;travel far and fast.</p>
<p>All at once, while the lovers were on their way, Antonuccio
turned his head and saw afar their pursuer on a mountain-road,
and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marietta, I see your father coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear, I will become a fair church and thou
shalt be the fine sexton (<i>sacristano</i>).&nbsp; And he will
ask thee if thou hast seen a girl and youth pass, and thou shalt
reply that he must first repeat the Paternoster and not the Ave
Maria.&nbsp; And if he asks again, tell him to say the Ave Maria
and not the Paternoster.&nbsp; And then, out of patience, he will
depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it came to pass, and the wizard was deceived.&nbsp; When he
had returned, his wife asked him what he had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a church and a sacristan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid that you are!&nbsp; The church was
Marietta&mdash;fly, fly and catch them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he set forth again, and again he was seen from afar by
Antonuccio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marietta, I see your father coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; Now I will become a beautiful garden, and
thou the gardener.&nbsp; And when my father comes and asks if
thou hast seen a couple pass, reply that thou weedest lettuces,
not broccoli.&nbsp; And when he asks again, answer that thou
weedest broccoli, not lettuces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it all came to pass, and the wizard, out of patience,
returned home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what did you see?&rdquo; inquired his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a garden and a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&ldquo;<i>Ahi&mdash;stupido</i>!&nbsp; Those were the
two.&nbsp; Start!&nbsp; This time I will go with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while Antonuccio saw the two following, and gaining on
them rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marietta, here come your father and mother.&nbsp; Now
we are in a nice mess.&rdquo; <a name="citation147"></a><a
href="#footnote147" class="citation">[147]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&nbsp; Now I will become a
fountain fair and broad, like a small lake, and thou a pretty
pigeon, to whom they will call; but for mercy&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t let yourself be taken, for then all will be over with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizard and his wife came to the fountain and saw the dove,
and tried to inveigle and catch it with grain.&nbsp; But it would
not be caught, neither could the witch quench her thirst with the
water.&nbsp; So, finding that both were beyond her power, she
cried in a rage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Antonuccio kisses his mother,<br />
He&rsquo;ll forget Marietta and every other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, when the parents were gone, the pair set forth again, till
they came to a place not far from where the mother of Antonuccio
lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go and see my mother,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go, for she will kiss thee, and thou wilt forget
me,&rdquo; replied Marietta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will take good care that she does not kiss
me,&rdquo; answered Antonuccio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only wait a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went and saw his mother, and both were in great joy at
meeting again, but he implored her not to kiss him.&nbsp; And
being weary, he went to sleep, and his mother, unheeding his
request, kissed him while he slept.&nbsp; And when he awoke,
Marietta was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>So the curse of the witch came to pass.&nbsp; And he lived
with his mother, and in time fell in love with another
girl.&nbsp; Then they appointed a day for their wedding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marietta lived where she had been left, and made a
fairy friend who knew all that was going on far and near.&nbsp;
One day she told Marietta that Antonuccio was to be married.</p>
<p>Marietta begged her to go and steal some dough (from the house
of the bride).&nbsp; The friend did so, and Marietta made of the
dough two cakes in the form of puppets, or children, and one she
called Antonuccio and the other Marietta.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Then,
on the day of the feast, the first day of the wedding, she begged
her friend to go and put the two puppets on the bridal table.</p>
<p>She did so, and when all were assembled, the puppet Marietta
began to speak:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember, Antonuccio,<br />
How, when my father brought thee to his house,<br />
My mother wished to take away thy life?<br />
And how he bade thee sweep the stable clean?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the other replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I remember the day.&rdquo; <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Marietta sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember, Antonuccio,<br />
How &rsquo;twas I aided thee to clear the field?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I remember the day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sang again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember how thou hadst no
work<br />
Upon the day when they would murder thee,<br />
And how we fled together to escape?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I <span class="GutSomerset">remember</span> the
day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the true Antonuccio, who was present, began to
remember what had taken place.&nbsp; Then the puppet Marietta
sang again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember how I was the church,<br
/>
And thou of it becam&rsquo;st the sacristan?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I remember the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember how I was a garden,<br />
And how thou didst become its gardener?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I now remember the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember how I was a fountain,<br />
And thou a pigeon flying over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I now remember the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou remember, Antonuccio,<br />
How &rsquo;twas my mother laid a curse on me,<br />
And how she said before she went away&mdash;<br />
When Antonuccio kisses his mother<br />
He&rsquo;ll forget Marietta and every other?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing away, passing away,<br />
Well do I now remember the day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Antonuccio himself remembered it all, and rising from the
table, ran from the house to where Marietta dwelt&mdash;and
married her.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This story, adds Miss Lister, is somewhat abbreviated, since
in the original the puppet Marietta, for the edification of all
assembled, repeats the whole story.</p>
<p>It will be at once observed that there is in all this no
special reference to Virgil as a character, as he appears in
other legends, the reason being that the old woman who narrated
it simply understood by the word Virgilio <i>any</i> magician of
any kind.&nbsp; So in another tale a youth exclaims, &ldquo;Art
thou what is called <i>a</i> Virgil?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is curious
as indicating that the word has become generic in Italian
folk-lore.&nbsp; But Virgil is even here, as elsewhere on the
whole, a man of kind heart.&nbsp; He has had his garden robbed
and his daughter stolen, but he displays at all times a kindly
feeling to Antonuccio.&nbsp; It is his wife, the witch, who shows
all the spite.</p>
<p>Nor is this, like the rest, a witch-story which belongs
entirely to esoteric, unholy, or secret lore, specially embodying
instruction and an incantation.&nbsp; It is a mere nursery
legend, the commonest of Italian <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>fairy-tales, to be found in all
collections in whole or in part.&nbsp; It is spread all over
Europe, and has found its way through Canadian-French to the Red
Indians of North America&mdash;apropos of which I would remind a
certain very clever reviewer and learned folk-lorist that because
many French tales are found among the Algonkin tribes, it does
not follow, as he really intimates, that the said Redskins have
no other traditions.</p>
<p>But even in this version there are classic traces.&nbsp; The
cleaning out of the Augean stables by Hercules is one, and the
spell of oblivion another.</p>
<p>I do not know what the origin may be of the head of the
sorcerer rising from the surface of the earth with ears like
mushrooms, implying that they were very large; but I find in an
edition of the &ldquo;Meditations of Saint Augustin,&rdquo;
Venice, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1588, illustrated with
rude, quaint pictures, one in which the holy father is kneeling
before a crucifix, while there rises from the ground before him a
great and terrible head with one very long ear.&nbsp; By it lies
the usual skull, one-fifth its size.&nbsp; Were two women
substituted for the saint, it would be a perfect illustration of
the strange scene described in the story.&nbsp; It is, to say the
least, a singular coincidence.</p>
<p>This story is therefore of some value as indicating that the
general term of sorcerer, magician or wizard, is used as a
synonym for Virgil, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; As Lucan
writes in his &ldquo;Pharsalia&rdquo;: &ldquo;Nec sua Virgilio
permisit nomina soli.&rdquo; <a name="citation150"></a><a
href="#footnote150" class="citation">[150]</a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that there is in the Museum of Florence an
Etruscan mirror on which Mercury and Minerva are represented as
looking at a human head apparently coming from the ground.&nbsp;
It may be that <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>of Orpheus lying upon it; in any case, it is strangely
suggestive of these tales.&nbsp; I am indebted for a tracing of
this mirror to the Rev. J. Wood Brown, author of the &ldquo;Life
of Michael Scott, the Magician and Philosopher,&rdquo; wherein
the latter hath a dual affinity to Virgil, and it is very
remarkable, as I have elsewhere noted, that the splitting a hill
into three is near Rome ascribed to the Roman poet.</p>
<p>A curious book could be written on heads, decapitated, which
have spoken.&nbsp; There is, I believe, a legend to the effect
that the caput of John the Baptist thus conversed, and it may be
that the New Testament only gives a fragment of the original
history.&nbsp; The belief that Herodias was a sorceress, and a
counterpart of Diana as queen of the witches, was generally
established so early as the second century, but is far older, the
original Herodias having been a form of Lilith. <a
name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a></p>
<p>It is specially to be noted in connection with this tale that
one of the older legends given in &ldquo;Virgilius the Sorcerer
of Rome&rdquo; expressly declares that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Virgilius made an iron head which could not
only speak, but also foretell the future; and, as some say, it
was by misinterpreting the oracle that Virgilius met his death in
this wise.&nbsp; Being about to undertake a journey, he asked the
head if it would come to a good end.&nbsp; The reply was:
&lsquo;Yes, if he took care of <i>his head</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Taking this to mean the oracle itself, Virgilius took every
measure to secure it, and with light heart went his way, but
while journeying, exposed to sunshine, he was seized with a fever
in the head, of which he died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is again like the death of Michael Scott.</p>
<h2><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>VIRGIL, THE WICKED PRINCESS, AND THE IRON MAN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An iron man who did on her attend,<br />
His name was Talus, made of yron mould,<br />
Immoveable, resistlesse&mdash;without end.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>:
<i>Faerie Queene</i>, v. c. i.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There once lived a Princess who was beautiful beyond words,
but wicked beyond belief; her whole soul was given to murder and
licentiousness; yet she was so crafty as to escape all suspicion,
and this pleased her best of all, for deceit was to her as dear
as life itself.&nbsp; And this she managed, as many another did
in those days, by inveigling through her agents handsome young
men into her palace by night, where they were invited to a
banquet and then to a bed, and all went gaily till the next
morning at breakfast, when the Princess gave her victim in wine
or food a terrible and rapid poison, after which the corpse was
carried away secretly by her servants to be thrown into the
river, or hidden in some secret vault; and thus it was the lady
sinned in secret while she kept up a white name before the
world.</p>
<p>Now it came to pass that a young man, who was a great friend
of Virgil, was taken in the snare by this Princess, and put to
death and no more heard of, when the great poet by his magic art
learned the whole truth.&nbsp; Then for revenge or punishment he
made a man of iron with golden locks, very beautiful to behold as
a man, with sympathetic, pleasing air, one who conversed fluently
and in a winning voice; and yet he was all of iron, and the
spirit who was conjured into him was one without pity or
mercy.</p>
<p>Then Virgil bade the Iron Man walk to and fro past the palace
of the Princess, and she, seeing him, was more pleased than she
had ever been before, and at once sent out a messenger, who
invited him to enter by a secret gate, which he did, and was
warmly received, and treated with a great display of love.&nbsp;
And in the morning at breakfast, as the Princess hesitated to
give him the deadly drink, for she had at last fallen madly in
love, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is the poison?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t keep me
waiting!&nbsp; Quick, that I may drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when she heard that she was indeed terrified, thinking, <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>&ldquo;This
man knows all my secret.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as she hesitated, he
took the deadly cup and drained it to the last drop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I am
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Iron Man said with scorn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call <i>that</i> stuff poison?&nbsp; Why, it
would hardly kill a mouse.&nbsp; Give me stronger, I
say&mdash;stronger!&nbsp; I live on poison, and the stronger it
is the better I like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the Princess felt from head to foot as if her
blood were all turned to ice, for now she knew that she was lost,
and her punishment at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Iron Man, &ldquo;since all the
poisoning and treachery and putting away of young gentlemen is at
an end, you must come with me;&rdquo; and with this he took her
under his left arm and went forth.</p>
<p>At her screams all her retainers came armed, and after them
twenty soldiers, but all were of no avail against such an enemy,
whom they could neither pierce with steel nor restrain by
strength; and escaping with her, he mounted a black steed, which
a Moor was holding outside, and with his victim flew over the
land till they came to a dark and savage place in the
mountains.&nbsp; And here he bore her into a vast cavern, where
many men were seated round a table, and as she looked she saw
that they were all the lovers whom she had put to death.&nbsp;
Then they all cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ecco la nostra moglie</i>!&nbsp; Behold our
wife!&nbsp; Behold our Drusiana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And another said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us give her to drink, and let us drink to
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they gave her a full goblet, which she could not help
swallowing, and the wine was like fire, the fire of hell itself
in all her veins.&nbsp; The men assembled round burst into
laughter at seeing her suffering, and one shouted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Drink, Princess, drink!<br />
Thou feelest the same fire,<br />
Only in greater measure,<br />
Hotter, wilder and fiercer,<br />
Which thou didst feel before,<br />
When thy blood boiled with passion,<br />
And with love of secret murder;<br />
Then thou didst feel it a little,<br />
Now thou shalt feel it greatly;<br />
Once it ran drop by drop,<br />
Now in full goblets and frequent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then another gave her a glass of wine which she could <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>not help
swallowing, and it was cold, and her blood again grew cold as
ice, and she shivered in an agony of freezing.&nbsp; And so it
went on, everyone giving her first the scalding hot wine and then
the cold, while all sang in chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We give thee again in thy heart<br />
What thou didst give to us:<br />
The heat of love which burned in us,<br />
Burned in us and in thee,<br />
And the cold of desire when satisfied.<br />
Thou hadst no mercy on us:<br />
We have as little for thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The connection of Virgil with the classic Talus, or Iron Man,
and so many other ancient legends, as shown in these which I have
gathered, renders the more striking the assertion that
&ldquo;after the sixteenth century the Vergilian legends
disappear, and become known only to scholars,&rdquo; as worded by
E. F. M. Beneche in his translation of Comparetti&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; The truth is, that as the age of credulity and mere
marvels passed away among the higher classes, the learned ceased
to collect or take an interest in heaping up &ldquo;wonders upon
wonders.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the people went on telling and making
tales about Virgil, just as they had always done.&nbsp; And the
full proof that there was not a soul who for centuries took the
least interest in folklore or popular tradition in Central and
Northern Italy is to be found in the fact that, while such
material <i>abounds</i> in the English, French, and especially
German literature of later ages, there is hardly a trace of it in
a single Roman or Tuscan writer till of late years.&nbsp; Even at
the present day there is small search or seeking in Northern
Italy for the rich treasures of old Roman tradition which still
exist among the people.</p>
<h2><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>GIOVANNI DI BOLOGNA AND THE GOD MERCURY.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;Mercurium omnium Deorum antiquorum
vigilantissimum ac maxime negotiis implicatum, scribit Hesiodus
in Theogoni&agrave;.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Natalis
Comitis</span>: <i>Mythologia</i>, lib. v., 1616.</p>
<p>In the old times in Florence the Tuscans worshipped the idols
of Jupiter, and Bacchus, and Venus, and Mercury in their
temples.&nbsp; And sometimes those gods when conjured <a
name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a> came down to earth.</p>
<p>In those times there was in Florence <a
name="citation155b"></a><a href="#footnote155b"
class="citation">[155b]</a> a sculptor of Bologna named Giovanni,
the same who made the Diavolino in the Mercato Vecchio.&nbsp; He
was tormented by the desire to make a statue of such beauty that
there should not be its like in all the world; and he, moreover,
desired that this statue should be as if living, one not stiff
and fixed, but one like Mercury, all activity, and he was so full
of this thought that he had no rest even by night, for a certain
gentleman had said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in vain dost thou intoxicate thyself by studying
statues, saying, &lsquo;This one is beautiful, that still more
so; this sculptor&mdash;<i>&eacute; bravo</i>&mdash;has talent,
that even cleverer;&rsquo; but, after all, the best of their work
is motionless, and produces on me the effect of a corpse.&nbsp; I
should call him a clever sculptor who could make a statue
inspired with motion like a living man&mdash;<i>che caminasse o
magari saltasse</i>&mdash;who runs and hops, but not a piece of
marble merely carved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this moved Giovanni to make a statue which should not have
its equal in the world.&nbsp; And thinking of Mercury, the
liveliest and quickest of all the gods, who is ever flying like a
falcon, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I could behold him,<br />
Though &rsquo;twere but for once,<br />
I should have the model<br />
Of a wondrous statue<br />
Inspired unto life!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One evening Giovanni found himself in the Temple of Mercury,
that which is to-day called the Baptistery of Saint <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>John [and
there he found Virgilio], to whom he said that he so greatly
longed to see Mercury living and in flight.</p>
<p>Virgilio replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go at midnight to the hill of Vallombrosa when the moon
is full, and call the fairy Bellaria, who will aid
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giovanni went to the hill and called to Bellaria, but she made
no reply.&nbsp; So he returned to Virgilio, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not enough to simply call to her, she must be
<i>scongiurata</i>&mdash;called by an incantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Giovanni, having learned this, thus conjured her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stella lucente,<br />
Ed aria splendente,<br />
Col tuo splendor,<br />
Bell&rsquo; Aria infiamma<br />
Mercurio, e fa lo scendere<br />
In terra che io posso<br />
Levarne il modello!<br />
Tu che siei bella,<br />
Bella quanto buona,<br />
Fa mi questa grazia;<br />
Perche io sono molto,<br />
Molto infelice,<br />
Se non faro una statua<br />
Come il desiderio mio,<br />
Vedi Bellaria.<br />
Finquase&ugrave; in questo monte,<br />
Son venuto per potermi<br />
A te raccomandare;<br />
T&ugrave; prego non indugiare<br />
A far mi questa grazia,<br />
Perche sono infelice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shining star!<br />
Resplendent glowing air, <a name="citation156"></a><a
href="#footnote156" class="citation">[156]</a><br />
With thy burning splendour,<br />
Bell&rsquo; Aria, inflame,<br />
Inspire great Mercury,<br />
Make him descend to earth<br />
That he may copied be.<br />
Thou who art beautiful,<br />
As beautiful as good,<br />
Grant me, I pray, this grace,<br />
For I am lost in grief<br />
Because I cannot make<br />
A statue as I wish.<br />
Behold, Bellaria!<br />
I&rsquo;ve come unto this hill<br />
To beg this thing of thee!<br />
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>I pray
thee grant my prayer,<br />
For I am suffering.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Bellaria thus evoked Mercury:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mercurio mio, bel Mercurio,<br />
Per quell&rsquo; acqua corrente,<br />
E cel (cielo) splendente,<br />
E tu risplendi, risplendi amor<br />
Di bellezza, e come il vento,<br />
Come il fulmine lesto siei,<br />
Io sono stata<br />
Scongiurata,<br />
Scongiurata pel mio splendor,<br />
Per infiammarti<br />
Del mio calor<br />
Che tu scenda in terra<br />
Che vi&eacute; Giovanni<br />
Gian di Bologna,<br />
Primo scultore, vuol prendere da te<br />
Il modello,<br />
Ti prego di scendere<br />
Come un baleno<br />
Perche fino che non sarai sesato,<br />
Ne pure a me tornerebbe<br />
La mia pace perche<br />
Mi hanno scongiurata per te;<br />
Se questa grazia mi farai<br />
Non per me, ma per Giovanni,<br />
Tre segni mi darai&mdash;<br />
Lampo, tuono e fulmine<br />
Se questa grazi mi farai,<br />
I tre seguali mi darai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercury, beauteous God!<br />
By the rushing water!<br />
By the glowing heaven!<br />
As thou shinest, reflecting again<br />
Their beauty, and as the wind<br />
Or the lightning thou art fleet.<br />
Even so am I<br />
Conjured and compelled<br />
Even by mine own splendour<br />
To inspire, inflame<br />
Thee by mine own heat!<br />
That thou descend to earth,<br />
That Giovanni, born<br />
In Bologna, may<br />
As sculptor copy thee!<br />
I pray thee to descend,<br />
Even like lightning&rsquo;s flash,<br />
Since till thou art measured,<br />
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>I shall
not be in peace,<br />
Being myself invoked.<br />
If thou wilt grant this grace,<br />
Yet not for me but <i>Gian</i>,<br />
Accord to me three signs:<br />
The flash, the crash and bolt;<br />
Even as lightning comes,<br />
I pray thee grant me this!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in an instant there came all together in one the flash and
roar and thunderbolt, and Giovanni di Bologna beheld Mercury
flying in the heaven, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;E troppo leggiadro, troppo bello!<br />
Non posso dipingere una Stella<br />
Ne il vento, ne un bal&eacute;n,<br />
E finito la mia speranza.&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art too little and light, by far!<br />
I cannot paint a shining star,<br />
Nor the wild wind or lightning&mdash;then<br />
All hope is lost, ah me!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the beautiful Bellaria said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou canst not depict Mercury flying through the
air, it may be that thou canst make him passing over the waves,
for then his speed is not so great.&rdquo;&nbsp; [So she invoked
Mercury again, and he was seen flitting over the ocean.] <a
name="citation158"></a><a href="#footnote158"
class="citation">[158]</a></p>
<p>But when Giovanni di Bologna beheld Mercury leaping from wave
to wave like a dolphin, he cried:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bel Mercurio, sempre <i>vale</i>!<br />
Io non sono che un mortale,<br />
Io non posso tanto fare,<br />
Ne le tue grazzie combinare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, fair Mercury, all is o&rsquo;er,<br />
I&rsquo;m but a mortal and no more,<br />
I cannot give again thy face,<br />
And least of all thy wondrous grace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bellaria said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast asked too much; it is not possible for thee
to make fire and water to the life.&nbsp; Yet be at ease, for
what may not be done in water or in air may come to pass with
ease upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bellaria again invoked Mercury, who descended like the wind in
a leap, even as a man leaps down and alights on earth.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Then
Giovanni cried:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Grazia &agrave; Dio!<br />
Io ho l&rsquo; ide&agrave;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to God divine!<br />
The <i>idea</i> is mine!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so Giovanni made the beautiful statue of Mercury in
bronze; and so long as the Tuscans worshipped their idols it was
wont to dance, but after they ceased this worship, it danced no
more.&nbsp; [At present, the beautiful statue of Mercury in
bronze is in the Bargello.]</p>
<p>It is said that Bellaria is the sister of Mercury, and that
both fly in the air.&nbsp; When the <i>Fate</i> or fairies, or
good witches die, Bellaria descends, and then bears their souls
to heaven.</p>
<p>Mercury is the god of all people who are in haste, who have
occasion to go rapidly&mdash;as, for instance, those who wish to
send a letter quickly and receive a speedy reply.&nbsp; To do
this, you must have an image of Mercury cast in bronze, and it
must be made to shine like silver, with a bright colour like a
looking-glass; <a name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a> and this should be worshipped before
going to bed, and on rising in the morning adore it again.&nbsp;
And to invoke Mercury, this is the manner: You must have a basin
full of water, taken from a stream when agitated (<i>i.e.</i>,
running water), and in the evening, as in the morning, take that
basin and make a cross on the earth where you kneel down, and
then say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Acqua corrente<br />
E vento furente,<br />
Avanti la statua di Mercurio<br />
Mi inghinnocchio, perche Mercurio,<br />
E il mio idole, Mercurio!<br />
E il mio dio;<br />
Acqua corrente<br />
E vento furente,<br />
Infuriate Mercurio<br />
A farmi questa grazia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running water, raging wind!<br />
Before the form of Mercury I kneel,<br />
For Mercury is my idol and my god!<br />
Running water, raging wind,<br />
Inspire great Mercury<br />
To do what I desire!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mercurio, Mercurio!<br />
Tu che siei il mio Dio!<br />
Fammi questa grazia<br />
Che io ti chiedo,<br />
Se questa grazia a me concedi<br />
Tre cose fammi vedere;<br />
Tuono, lampo e vento infuriato!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercury, Mercury divine!<br />
Who ever art a god of mine!<br />
Grant me that which I do need,<br />
And if&rsquo;t be given me indeed,<br />
Cause me then three things to see&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lightning&rsquo;s flash,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thunder crash,<br />
And the wind roaring furiously!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And where the water from the running stream has been poured it
must be carefully covered over, so that no one can tread thereon,
or else from that time the favour of Mercury will cease.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It would seem as if this story were originally intended to
imply that the sculptor, unable to give a higher conception of
vivacity or motion, represented the mobile god as in the moment
of descending on earth, still preserving the attitude of
flight.&nbsp; This conception was probably too subtle for the
narrator, who describes the image as having been a kind of
marionette, or dancing Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whate&rsquo;er it be,
it is a curious tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The connection of Mercury with moving water is also
remarkable.&nbsp; He bears serpents on his <i>caduceus</i> or
wand; and among other ancient myth-fancies, a rushing river, from
its shape or windings and its apparent life, was a symbol of a
serpent.</p>
<p>It is hardly worth while to note that Giovanni di Bologna was
really a Frenchman&mdash;Jean de Boulogne.&nbsp; The bronze
Mercury by him described in this story, and <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>now in the
Bargello Museum, is supposed to have suggested the allusion to
the god as</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;just
alighted<br />
On a heaven-kissing hill,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the probability is indeed of the strongest.&nbsp; Many
judges good and true are of the opinion that, as regards motive
or conception, this is the best statue ever made by any save a
Greek, as there is assuredly none in which the lightness of
motion is so perfectly expressed in matter.&nbsp; I believe,
however, that Giovanni di Bologna was indebted for this figure to
some earlier type or motive.&nbsp; There is something not unlike
it among the old Etruscan small bronze <i>figurini</i>.</p>
<h2>THE DOUBLE-FACED STATUE, OR HOW VIRGILIO CONJURED JANUS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now by two-headed Janus!<br />
Nature hath formed strange fellows in her time!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were in Rome many temples of Janus, some unto him
as <i>bifrons</i>, or double-faced.&nbsp; Caylus has published
pictures of Greek vases on which are seen two heads thus united,
the one of an elderly man, the other of a young
woman.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dizionario Mitologico</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was once in Florence, in the Tower della Zeccha, a
statue of great antiquity, and it had only one body, or bust, but
two heads; and one of these was of a man and the other of a
woman, a thing marvellous to behold.</p>
<p>And Virgil, seeing this when it was first found in digging
amid old ruins, had it placed upright and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold two beings who form but a single person!&nbsp; I
will conjure the image; it shall be a charm to do good; it shall
teach a lesson to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he conjured:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Statua da due faccie<br />
Due, e un corpo solo,<br />
Due faccie ed avete<br />
Un sol cervello.&nbsp; Siete<br />
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Due
esseri l&rsquo; uno per altro,<br />
Dovete essere marito e moglie,<br />
Dovete peccare con un sol pensiero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avete bene quattro occhi<br />
Ma una sol vista,<br />
Come tutti i mariti,<br />
E moglie dorebbere essere,<br />
E dovete fare la buona fortuna<br />
Di tutti gli inamorati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Statue gifted with two faces,<br />
Two and yet a single body!<br />
Two and but one brain&mdash;then art thou<br />
Two intended for each other&mdash;<br />
Two who should be wife and husband,<br />
Acting by the same reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unto you four eyes are given,<br />
And but a single sight&mdash;ye are then<br />
What indeed all wives and husbands<br />
Ought to be if they&rsquo;d be happy;<br />
Therefore shalt thou bring good fortune<br />
Unto all devoted lovers!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Virgil touched the statue with his rod, and it
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tutti quelli che mi pregherano.<br />
Di cuore sincera, amanti o sposi,<br />
Tutti quelli saranno felice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of those who&rsquo;ll come here to adore me,<br />
Be they lovers, be they married couples,<br />
I will ever make them truly happy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The conception of a head with two faces, one male and the
other female, is still very common in Italy.&nbsp; In the
cloister of Santa Maria Novella in Florence the portraits of a
husband and wife are thus united on a marble monumental
tablet.&nbsp; And in Baveno, among the many <i>graffiti</i> or
sketches and scrawls made by children on the walls on or near the
church, there is one which is evidently traditional, representing
Janus.&nbsp; This double-headed deity was continued in the
Baphomet of the Knights Templars.</p>
<p>In the older legends are two tales declaring that Virgil made
and enchanted two statues.&nbsp; This appears to be a variation
of the story of Janus.</p>

<p>On a time Virgilio remained for many weeks alone at home, and
never went to court.&nbsp; And during this retirement he made
seven bells of gold, and on every one there was engraved a name
or word.</p>
<p>On the first there was &ldquo;Bugiardo&rdquo; (or lying), on
the second &ldquo;Chiacchiera&rdquo; (or tattling gossip), on the
third &ldquo;Malignit&agrave;&rdquo; (or evil spite), on the
fourth &ldquo;Chalugna&rdquo; (or calumny), on the fifth
&ldquo;Maldicenza&rdquo; (or vituperation), on the sixth
&ldquo;Invidia&rdquo; (or envy), and on the seventh
&ldquo;Bassezza&rdquo; (or vileness).</p>
<p>And these he hung up in a draught of air, so that as they
swung in the breeze they rang and tinkled, first one alone, and
then all.</p>
<p>One day the Emperor sent a messenger to Virgilio, asking him
why he never came to court as of old.&nbsp; And Virgilio wrote in
reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear

<p>&ldquo;It is no longer necessary that I should come to court
to learn all that is said there.&nbsp; For where I am at home I
hear all day long the voices of Falsehood, Tattling, Evil Spite,
Calumny, Vituperation, Envy, and Vileness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he showed the bells to the messenger.&nbsp; The <a

when he had read the letter and heard all, laughed heartily, and
said:</p>

<p>Miss Roma Lister, when residing in Florence, having written to
her old nurse Maria, in Rome, asking her if she knew, or could
find, any tales of Virgil, received after a while the following
letter, written out by her son, who has evidently been well
educated, to judge by his style and admirable handwriting:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Rome</span>, <i>January</i> 28, 1897.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mia buona
Signorina</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been seeking for some old person, a native of
the Castelli Romani, who knew something relative to the magician
Virgil, and I found in a street of the new quarters of Rome an
old acquaintance, a man who is more than eighty years of age; and
on asking him for what I wanted, he, after some reflection,
recalled the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was a small boy when my parents told me that
in the Montagna della Sibilla there was once an old man who was
indeed so very old that the most ancient people had ever known
him as appearing of the same age, and he was called the magician
Virgilio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One day three shepherds were in a cabin at the
foot of the mountain, when the magician entered, and they were at
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>first
afraid of him, knowing his reputation.&nbsp; But he calmed them
by saying that he never did harm to anyone, and that he had come
down from the mountain to beg a favour from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;half-way up the mountain, a grotto, in which there is a
great serpent which keeps me from entering.&nbsp; Therefore I beg
you do me the kindness to capture it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The shepherds replied that they would do so,
thinking that he wanted them to kill the snake, but he explained
to them that he wished to have it taken in a very large bottle
(<i>grandissimo boccione</i>) <a name="citation165"></a><a
href="#footnote165" class="citation">[165]</a> by means of
certain herbs which he had provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the next day he came with the bottle and
certain herbs which were strange to them, and certainly not grown
in the country.&nbsp; And he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Go to the grotto, and lay the bottle down
with its mouth towards the cavern, and when the serpent shall
smell the herbs he will enter the bottle.&nbsp; Then do ye close
it quickly and bring it to me.&nbsp; And all of this must be done
without a word being spoken, else ye will meet with
disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So the three shepherds went their way, and after
a time came to the grotto, which they entered, and did as the
magician had ordered.&nbsp; Then, after a quarter of an hour, the
serpent, smelling the herbs, came forth and entered the
bottle.&nbsp; No sooner was he in it than one of the shepherds
adroitly closed it, and cried unthinkingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When all at once they felt the whole mountain
shake, and heard an awful roar, and crashing timber round on
every side, so that they fell on the ground half dead with
fear.&nbsp; When they came to their senses each one found himself
on the summit of a mountain, and the three peaks were far
apart.&nbsp; It took them several days to return to their cabin,
and all of them died a few days after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From that time the magician Virgil was no more
seen in the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all which I could learn; should I hear more I
will write at once to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>This
is beyond question an imperfectly-told tale.&nbsp; What the
sorcerer intended and effected was to divide a mountain into
three peaks, as did Michael Scott, of whom legends are still left
in Italy, as the reader may find by consulting the interesting
work by the Rev. J. Wood Brown. <a name="citation166"></a><a
href="#footnote166" class="citation">[166]</a>&nbsp; In the
Italian tale the three shepherds who were together find
themselves suddenly apart on the tops of three peaks, which
clearly indicates the real aim of the narrative.</p>
<p>An old Indian woman, widow of an Indian governor, told me, as
a thing unknown, that the three hills of Boston had been thus
split by Glusg&aacute;be or Glooscap, the great Algonkin
god.&nbsp; As this deity introduced culture to North America, it
will be at once perceived that there was something truly
<i>weirdly</i>, or strangely prophetic, in this act.&nbsp; As
Glooscap was the first to lay out Boston&mdash;<i>&agrave; la
Trinit&eacute;</i>&mdash;he certainly ought to be regarded as the
patron saint of that cultured city, and have at least a library,
a lyceum, or a hotel named after him in the American
Athens.&nbsp; The coincidence is very singular&mdash;Rome and
Boston!</p>
<p>Eildon Hill, by which, as I have heard, Andrew Lang was born,
is one of the picturesque places which attract legends and
masters in folk-lore.&nbsp; Of it I have a strange
souvenir.&nbsp; While in its vicinity I for three nights saw in a
dream the Fairy Queen, and the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; was
remarkably vivid, or so much so as to leave a strong or haunting
impression on my waking hours.&nbsp; It was like a glimpse into
elf-land.&nbsp; Of course it was simply the result of my
recalling and thinking deeply on the legend of &ldquo;True
Thomas,&rdquo; but the dream was very pleasant and
sympathetic.</p>

GOLDEN PINE-CONE.</h2>

</blockquote>
<p>There was once a young man named Constanzo, who was blessed,
as they say, in form and fortune, he being both fair in face and
rich.&nbsp; Now, whether it was that what he had seen and learned
of ladies at court had displeased him, is not recorded or
remembered, but one thing is certain, that he had made up his
mind to marry a poor girl, and so began to look about among
humble folk at the maids, which indeed pleased many of them
beyond belief, though it was taken ill by their parents, who had
but small faith in such attentions.</p>
<p>But the one whom it displeased most of all was the mother of
Constanzo, who, when he said that he would marry a poor girl,
declared in a rage that he should do nothing of the kind, because
she would allow no such person to come in the house.&nbsp; To
which he replied that as he was of age, and the master, he would
do as he pleased.&nbsp; Then there were ill words, for the mother
had a bad temper and worse will, and had gone the worst way to
work, because of all things her son could least endure being
governed.&nbsp; And she was the more enraged because her son had
hitherto always been docile and quiet, but she now found that she
had driven him up to a height which he had not before dreamed of
occupying and where he would now remain.&nbsp; But she vowed
vengeance in her heart, saying: &ldquo;Marry or not&mdash;this
shall cost thee dear.&nbsp; <i>Te lo far&ograve;
pagare</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many months passed, and no more was said, when one day the
young gentleman went to the chase with his friends, and impelled
by some strange influence, took a road and went afar into a part
of the country which was unknown to him.&nbsp; At noon they
dismounted to rest, when, being very thirsty, Constanzo expressed
a desire for water.</p>
<p>And just as he said it there came by a <i>contadina</i>,
carrying two jars of water, cold and dripping, fresh from a
fountain.&nbsp; And the young signor having drunk, observed that
the girl was of enchanting or dazzling beauty, with a charming
expression of innocence, which went to his heart.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;What is thy name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constanza,&rdquo; the girl replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Constanzo,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;and as our
names so our hearts shall be&mdash;one made for the
other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are a rich lord, and I am a poor girl,&rdquo;
she slowly answered, &ldquo;so it can never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as both had loved at sight, and sincerely, it was soon
arranged, and the end was that the pair were married, and
Constanza became a signora and went to live in the castle with
her lord.&nbsp; His mother, who was more his enemy than ever, and
ten times that of his wife, made no sign of anger, but professed
love and devotion, expressing delight every day and oftener that
her son had chosen so fair a wife, and one so worthy of him.</p>
<p>It came to pass that Constanza was about to become a mother,
and at this time her husband was called to the wars, and that so
far away that many days must pass before he could send a letter
to his home.&nbsp; But his mother showed herself so kind, though
she had death and revenge at her heart, that Constanzo was
greatly relieved, and departed almost light of heart, for he was
a brave man, as well as good, and such people borrow no trouble
ere it is due.</p>
<p>But the old signora looked after him with bitterness, saying,
&ldquo;Thou shalt pay me, and the hour is not far
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when she saw his wife she murmured:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now revenge shall take its shape;<br />
Truly thou canst not escape;<br />
Be it death or be it dole,<br />
I will sting thee to the soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when the hour came that the countess was to be confined,
the old woman told her that she herself alone would serve and
attend to all&mdash;<i>e che avrebbe fatto tutto da se</i>.&nbsp;
But going forth, she found a pine-tree and took from it a cone,
which she in secret set to boil in water, singing to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bolli, bolli!<br />
Senza posa.<br />
Che nel letto<br />
Vi &eacute; la sposa,<br />
Un fanciullo<br />
Alla luce mi dara,<br />
E una pina diventera!</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;Bolli, bolli!<br />
Mio decotto<br />
Bolli, bolli!<br />
Senza posa!<br />
Il profumo<br />
Che tu spandi,<br />
Si spanda<br />
In corpo alla<br />
Alla sposa e il figlio,<br />
Il figlio che fara<br />
Pina d&rsquo; oro diventera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boil and boil,<br />
Rest defying!<br />
In the bed<br />
The wife is lying;<br />
Soon her babe<br />
The light will see,<br />
But a pine-cone<br />
It shall be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boil and boil,<br />
And well digest!<br />
Boil and boil,<br />
And never rest!<br />
May the perfume<br />
Which you spread<br />
Thrill the body<br />
To the head,<br />
And the child<br />
Which we shall see,<br />
A golden pine-cone<br />
Let it be!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And soon the countess gave birth to a beautiful daughter with
golden hair, but the old woman promptly took the little one and
bathed it in the water in which she had boiled the pine-cone,
whereupon it became a golden pine-cone, and the poor mother was
made to believe that this was her first-born; and the same was
written to the father, who replied to his wife that, whatever
might happen, he would ever remain as he had been.</p>
<p>The mother-in-law took the pine-cone and placed it on a
mantelpiece, as such curious or odd things are generally disposed
of.&nbsp; And when her son returned she contrived in so many ways
and with craft to calumniate his wife that the poor lady was ere
long imprisoned in a tower.</p>
<p>But a strange thing now happened, for every night the
pine-cone, unseen by all, left like a living thing its place on
the chimney-piece and wandered over the castle, returning <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>at five
o&rsquo;clock to its place, but ever going just below the
lady&rsquo;s window, where it sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O cara madre mia!<br />
Luce degli occhi miei!<br />
Cessa quel pianto,<br />
E non farmi pi&ugrave; soffrir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mother, darling mother,<br />
Light of my eyes, I pray<br />
That thou wilt cease thy weeping,<br />
So mine may pass away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, after he had shut his wife up in the tower, Constanzo had
not an instant&rsquo;s peace of mind.&nbsp; Therefore, to be
assured, he one day went to consult the great magician
Virgil.&nbsp; And having told all that had happened, the wise man
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast imprisoned thy wife, she who is pure and
true, in a tower, and all on the lying words and slanders of that
vile witch your mother.&nbsp; And thou hast suffered bitterly,
and well deserved it, as all do who are weak enough to believe
evil reports of a single witness; for who is there who may not
lie, especially among women, when they are jealous and full of
revenge?&nbsp; Now do thou set free thy wife (and bid her come to
me and I will teach her what to do).&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the count obeyed.</p>
<p>Then the mother took the pine-cone and threw it up three times
into the air, singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pina, mia bella pina!<br />
Dei pini tu sei regina!<br />
Dei pini sei prottetrice,<br />
D&rsquo; un pino pianta la radice!<br />
E torna una fanciulla bella<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come un occhio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Di sole in braccio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tuo padre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed a tua madre!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pine, the fairest ever seen,<br />
Of all cones thou art the queen!<br />
Guarding them in sun or shade,<br />
And &rsquo;tis granted that, when planted,<br />
Thou shalt be a charming maid,<br />
Ever sweet and ever true<br />
To thy sire and mother too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>And
this was done, and the cone forthwith grew up a fair maid, who
was the joy of her parents&rsquo; life.&nbsp; But the people in a
rage seized on the old witch, who was covered with a coat of
pitch and burned alive in the public square.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This legend was gathered in and sent to me from Siena.&nbsp;
As a narrative it is a fairy-tale of the most commonplace
description, its incidents being found in many others.&nbsp; But
so far as the pine-cone is concerned it is of great originality,
and retains remarkable relics of old Latin lore.&nbsp; The
pine-tree was a favourite of Cybele, and it was consecrated to
Silvanus, who is still known and has a cult in the mountains of
the Romagna Toscana.&nbsp; This rural deity often bore a
pine-cone in his hand.&nbsp; Propertius also assigns the pine to
Pan.&nbsp; The cone was pre-eminently a phallic emblem, therefore
specially holy; in this sense it was placed on the staff borne by
the specially initiated to Bacchus.&nbsp; It was incredibly
popular as an amulet, on account of its supposed magical virtues,
therefore no one object is more frequently produced in ancient
art.&nbsp; A modern writer, observing this, and not being able to
account for it, very feebly attributes it to the fact that the
object is so common that it is naturally used for a model.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Artists,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in fact prefer to use what
comes ready to hand, and to copy such plants as are ever under
their eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; So writes the great dilettante Caylus,
forgetting that a thousand objects quite as suitable to
decoration as the pine-cone, and quite as common, were not used
at all.</p>
<p>The pine typified a new birth, according to Friedrich; this
was because it was evergreen, and therefore sacred as immortal to
Cybele.&nbsp; Thus Ovid (&ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo; x. 103)
writes, &ldquo;<i>Pinus grata deum matri</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
French Layard, in the new &ldquo;Annales de l&rsquo;Institut <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Arch&aelig;ologique,&rdquo; vol. xix., has emphatically
indicated the connection of the pine-cone with the cult of Venus,
and as a reproductive symbol.&nbsp; It is in this sense clearly
set forth in the Italian or Sienese legend, where the pine-cone
planted in the earth grows up as the girl with golden
locks.&nbsp; This is very probably indeed the relic of an old
Roman mythical tale or poem.</p>
<p>The golden pine-cone appears in other tales.&nbsp; Wolf
(&ldquo;Zeitschrift f&uuml;r deutsche Mythologie,&rdquo; vol. i.,
p. 297) says that in Franconia there were once three travelling
<i>Handwerksburschen</i>, or craftsmen, who met with a beautiful
lady, who when asked for alms gave to each a pine-cone from a
tree.&nbsp; Two of them threw the gifts away, but the third found
his changed to solid gold.&nbsp; In order to make an amulet which
is kept in the house, pine-cones are often gilded in Italy.&nbsp;
I have seen them here in Florence, and very pretty ornaments they
make.</p>

name, took Gega indeed as a daughter, and taught her to weave,
which was a good trade in those days, and in that place where few
practised it.&nbsp; So it came to pass that they made money,
which was laid by.&nbsp; [This was no great wonder, for the old
loom had a strange enchantment in it, by which marvellous work
could be produced.]</p>
<p>The old woman very often bade Gega take great care of the
loom, and the girl could not understand why Nunzia thought so
much of it, since it seemed to her to be like any other.&nbsp;
[For it never appeared strange to her that when she wove the
cloth seemed to almost come of itself&mdash;a great deal for a
little thread&mdash;and that its quality or kind improved as she
applied herself to work, for in her ignorance she believed that
this was the way with all weaving.]</p>
<p>At last the old Mamma Nunzia died, and Gega, left alone, began
to make acquaintances and friends with other girls who came to
visit her.&nbsp; Among these was one named Ermelinda, who was at
heart as treacherous and rapacious as she was shrewd, yet one
withal who, what with her beauty and deceitful airs, knew how to
flatter and persuade to perfection, so that she could make a
simple girl like Gega believe that the moon was a pewter plate,
or a black fly white.</p>
<p>Now, the first time that she and several others, who were all
weavers, saw Gega at work, they were greatly amazed, for the
cloth seemed to come of itself from a wretched old loom which
appeared to be incapable of making anything, and it was so fine
and even, and had such a gloss that it looked like silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&nbsp; One would say it was silk!&rdquo;
cried a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can make silk when I try,&rdquo; answered Gega;
and applying her will to it, she presently spun from
cotton-thread a yard of what was certainly real silk stuff.</p>
<p>And seeing this, all present declared that Gega must be a
witch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;you could all do
it if you tried as I do.&nbsp; As for being a witch, it is
Ermelinda and <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>not I who should be so, for she first said it was like
silk, and made it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ermelinda saw that there was magic in the loom, of which
Gega knew nothing, so she resolved to do all in her power to
obtain it.&nbsp; And this she effected firstly by flattery, and
giving the innocent girl extravagant ideas of her beauty,
assuring her that she had an attractiveness which could not fail
to win her a noble husband, and that, having laid by a large sum
of money, she should live on it in style till married, and that
in any case she could go back to her weaving.&nbsp; But that on
which she laid most stress was that Gega should leave her old
lodging and get rid of her dirty old furniture, and especially of
that horrible, crazy old loom, persuading her that, if she ever
should have occasion to weave again, she, with her talent, could
do far better with a new loom, and probably gain thrice as much,
all of which the simple girl believed, and so let her false
friend dispose of everything, in doing which Ermelinda did not
fail to keep the loom herself, declaring that nobody would buy
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I am content.&nbsp;
Thou art very beautiful; all that thou needest is to be elegantly
dressed, and have fine things about thee, to soon catch a fine
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gega assented to this, but was loth to part with her old loom,
which she had promised Nunzia should never be neglected; but
Ermelinda promised so faithfully to keep it carefully for her,
that she was persuaded to let her have it.&nbsp; Then the young
girl took a fine apartment, well furnished, and bought herself
beautiful clothes, and, guided by her false friend, began to go
to entertainments and make fashionable friends, and live as if
she were rich.</p>
<p>Then Ermelinda, having obtained the old loom, went to work
with it, in full hope that she too could spin silk out of cotton,
but found out to her amazement and rage that she could do nothing
of the kind&mdash;nay, she could not so much as weave common
cloth from it; all that she got after hours of fruitless effort
was a headache, and the conviction that she had thrown away all
her time and trouble, which made her hate Gega all the more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the latter for a time enjoyed life as she had never
done before; but though she looked anxiously to the right and the
left for a husband, found none, the well-to-do young men being
quite as anxious to wed wealth as she was, <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>and all of
them soon discovered on inquiry that she had little or nothing,
despite her style of living, and her money rapidly melted away,
till at last she found that to live she must work&mdash;there was
no help for it.&nbsp; With what remained she bought a fine loom
and thread, and sat down to weave; but though she succeeded in
making common stuff like others, it was not silk, nor anything
like it, nor was there anyone who would buy what she made.&nbsp;
In despair she remembered what Mamma Nunzia had solemnly said to
her, that she must never part from the old loom, so she went to
Ermelinda to reclaim it.&nbsp; But her false friend, although she
could do nothing with the loom herself, was not willing that
Gega, whom she hated with all her heart, should in any way
profit, and declared that her mother had broken up and burned the
rubbishy old thing, and to this story she adhered, and when Gega
insisted on proof of it, drove her in a rage out of the
house.</p>
<p>While Mamma Nunzia was living she, being a very wise woman,
had taught Gega with care the properties and nature of plants,
roots, herbs, and flowers, saying that some day it might be of
value to her, as it is to everyone.&nbsp; So whenever they had a
holiday they had gone into the fields and woods, where the girl
became so expert that she could have taught many a doctor very
strange secrets; and withal, the Mamma also made her learn the
charms and incantations which increase the power of the
plants.&nbsp; So now, having come to her last coin, and finding
there was some profit in it, she began to gather herbs for
medicine, which she sold to chemists and others in the
towns.&nbsp; And finding a deserted old tower in a wild and rocky
place, she was allowed to make it her home; and indeed, after all
she had gone through, and her disappointment both as to friends
and lovers, she found herself far happier when alone than when in
a town, where she was ashamed to meet people who had known her
when she lived in style.</p>
<p>One evening as she was returning home she heard a groaning in
the woods as of someone in great suffering, and, guided by the
sound, found a poor old woman seated on a stone, who told her
that she had hurt her leg by slipping from a rock.&nbsp; And
Gega, who was as strong as she was kind and compassionate,
carried the poor soul in her arms to the tower, where she bound
an application of healing herbs to the wound, and bade her remain
and welcome.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;I have nothing to give you for it all,&rdquo;
said the old woman on the following day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did I do it in the hope of aught,&rdquo; replied
Gega.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the sufferer, &ldquo;I might be of
use to you.&nbsp; If, for example, you have lost anything, I can
tell you how to recover it or where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Gega, &ldquo;if thou canst do that,
thou wilt be a friend indeed, for I have lost my fortune&mdash;it
was a loom which was left to me by Mamma Nunzia.&nbsp; I did not
regard her advice never to part with it, and I have bitterly
repented my folly.&nbsp; I trusted it to a friend, who betrayed
me, for she burned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, she did nothing of the kind,&rdquo;
replied the old woman; &ldquo;she has it yet, and I will make it
return to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she repeated this invocation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Telaio!&nbsp; Telaio!&nbsp; Telaio!<br />
Che per opera e virt&uacute;<br />
Del gran mago Virgilio<br />
Fosti fabricato,<br />
E di tante virt&ugrave; adornato<br />

Tu possa di una tela<br />
Di oro di argento<br />
Essere ordito.<br />
E come il vento,<br />
Dalla casa di Ermelinda,<br />
Tu possa sortire,<br />

<p>&ldquo;Loom!&nbsp; Loom!&nbsp; O loom!<br />

I pray thee by that skill<br />
And labour given by<br />

<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Into the

Where once my daughter dwelt,<br />
All by the skill and power<br />
Of great Virgilius!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When in an instant they were borne away on a mighty wind and
found themselves in the old room, and there also they found the
loom, from which Gega could now weave at will cloth of gold or
silver as well as silk.</p>
<p>Then the old woman looked steadily at Gega, and the girl saw
the features of the former change to those of Nunzia, and as she
embraced her, the old woman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Mamma Nunzia, and I came from afar to restore
to thee thy loom; but guard it well now, for if lost thou canst
never recover it again.&nbsp; But if thou shouldst ever need
aught, then invoke the grand magician Virgil, because he has
always been my god.&rdquo; <a name="citation177"></a><a
href="#footnote177" class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<p>Having said this, she departed, and Gega knew now that Nunzia
was a white witch or a fairy.&nbsp; So, becoming rich, she was a
lady, and ever after took good care of her loom and distrusted
flattering friends.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This legend exists as a fairy-tale in many forms, and may be
found in many countries; perhaps its beginning was in that of the
princess who could spin straw into gold.&nbsp; To have some
object which produces food or money <i>ad libitum</i> when called
on, to be cheated out of it, and finally be revenged on the
cheater, is known to all.</p>
<p>Virgil is in one of these tales na&iuml;vely called a saint,
and in this he is seriously addressed as a god, by which we, of
course, understand a classical heathen deity, or any spirit
powerful enough to answer prayer with personal favours.&nbsp; But
Virgil as the maker of a magic loom which yields gold and silk,
and as a <i>god</i> at the same time, indicates a very possible
derivation from a very grand ancient myth.&nbsp; The reader is
probably familiar with the address of the Time Spirit in
Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;In Being&rsquo;s flood, in action&rsquo;s
storm,<br />
I work and weave, above, beneath&mdash;<br />
Work and weave in endless motion<br />
Birth and Death&mdash;an infinite ocean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A-seizing and giving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire of the Living.<br />
&rsquo;Tis thus at the roaring loom of Time I ply,<br />
And weave for God the garment thou see&rsquo;st Him
by.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Carlyle informs us, in &ldquo;Sartor Resartus,&rdquo;
that of the thousands who have spouted this really very
intelligible formula of pantheism, none have understood
it&mdash;implying thereby that to him it was no mystery.&nbsp;
But Carlyle apparently did not know, else he would surely have
told the reader, that the idea was derived from the Sanskrit myth
that Maya (delusion or appearance), &ldquo;the feminine half of
the divine primitive creator (Urwesen), was represented as
weaving the palpable universe from herself, for which reason she
was typified as a spider.&rdquo; <a name="citation178"></a><a
href="#footnote178" class="citation">[178]</a>&nbsp; Hence Maia
of the Greeks; and it is a curious coincidence that Maia in the
Neapolitan legends is the mother of Virgil, all of which is
confused, and may be accidental, but there may also be in it the
remains of some curious and very ancient tradition.&nbsp; The
spider was, however, certainly the emblem of domestic,
stay-at-home, steady industry, as Friedrich illustrates,
therefore of prosperity, hence it is believed to bring luck to
those on whom it crawls, as set forth in the novel of &ldquo;The
Red Spider.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is evident that the moral of this
tale of Virgil&rsquo;s loom is to the effect that the heroine
gained her good fortune by hard work at home, and came to grief
by gadding abroad and playing the belle.</p>
<p>That Maia, or Illusion or Glamour, should, according to our
tradition, be the mother of the greatest thaumaturgist,
wonder-worker, poet, and sorcerer of <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>yore is curious.&nbsp; That the
original Maya of India should be the living loom from which the
universe is spun, and that in another tale the <i>same</i>
magician, her son, is a god who makes a magic loom which spins
gold, silver, and silk, may be all mere chance coincidence, but,
if so, it is strange enough to rank as a miracle <i>per
se</i>.</p>
<p>The name Gega, with <i>g</i> the second soft, is very nearly
<i>Gaia</i>, the Goddess of the Earth, who was one with Maia, as
a type of the Universe.</p>
<p>As I regard this as a tradition of some importance, I would
state that it owes nothing whatever to any inquiry, hint, or
suggestion from me; that it was gathered from witch authority by
Maddalena, near Prato; and, finally, that it is very faithfully
translated, with the exception of the passages indicated by
brackets, which were inserted by me to make the text
clearer&mdash;a very necessary thing in most of these tales,
where much is often palpably omitted.&nbsp; I have seldom had a
story so badly written as this was; it appears to have been taken
down without correction from some illiterate old woman, who
hardly understood what she was narrating.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that in a number of these tales the
proper names are strangely antique and significant.&nbsp; They
are not such as are in use among the people, they would not even
be known to most who are tolerably well read.&nbsp; I have only
found several after special search in mythologies, etc.; and yet
they are, I sincerely believe, in all cases appropriate to the
tradition as in this case.</p>

<p>There is in Arezzo a lonely old lane or silent street where
few people care to go after dark, nor do they love it much even
by daylight, the reason being that it is haunted, for many have
seen walking up and down in it after midnight the form of a
ghostly friar, who is ever muttering to himself.&nbsp; So he
wanders, speaking to none, but now and then he seems to be in
great distress, and screams as if in agony, when light dim flames
fly from his mouth and nostrils, and then he suddenly
vanishes.</p>
<p>It is said that long, long ago there lived in or near Arezzo a
poor young orphan girl who had no relations, and had been taken
in charity as a servant in a farmer&rsquo;s family, where she was
not unkindly treated, but where everything was in harsh contrast
to the life which she had led at home, for her parents, though
poor, were gentle folk, and had brought her up tenderly.</p>
<p>So it happened that when at Easter she was ordered to kill for
the usual feast a pet lamb, because all the rest were too busy to
attend to it, she could not bring herself to do it, and wept
bitterly when the lamb looked at her, which the master and
mistress could not understand, and thought her very silly.&nbsp;
And being deeply grieved at all this, she could eat nothing, and
so went along weeping, wishing that her life were at an
end.&nbsp; And while walking she met a priest, who was indeed a
black sheep of the flock, or rather a wolf, for he was a hardened
villain at heart, and ready for any knavery; and he, seeing that
the girl, whose name was Ortenzia, was in distress, drew from her
all her sad story, and was very much interested at learning that
she had some small store of money and a few jewels and clothes,
which her mother had charged her not to part with, but to keep
till she should be married or for dire need.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Then
the priest, pretending great sympathy and pity, said that the
farm was no place for her, and that he himself was in great need
of a maid-servant, and if she would come and live with him she
should be to him as a daughter, and treated like a lady, with
much more honeyed talk of the kind, till at last she assented to
his request, at which he greatly rejoiced, and bade her be
careful to bring with her all her property; whereupon he lost no
time in inducing her to sign a paper transferring it all to him,
which she in her ignorance very willingly did.</p>
<p>The poor child found very soon indeed that she had only
changed the frying-pan for the fire, for the same night the
priest made proposals to her, which she rejected in anger, when
he attempted force, which she resisted, being strong and
resolute, and declared that she would leave his house at
once.&nbsp; But when she asked for her money and small property
he jeered at her, saying that she had <i>given</i> it to him, and
all the law in the land could not take it away.&nbsp; And more
than this, he declared she was possessed by a devil, and would
certainly be damned for resisting him, and that he would
excommunicate and curse her.&nbsp; Hearing all this, the girl
became mad in fact, and rushed forth.&nbsp; For a long time she
went roaming about the roads, in woods, and living on what people
gave her in pity; but no one knew what it was that had turned her
brain, and the priest, of course, said all that was ill and false
of her.</p>
<p>One day, as the poor lunatic sat in a lonely place singing and
making bouquets of wild-flowers, the priest passed, and he,
seeing her still young and beautiful, was again inspired by
passion, and threw his arms about her.&nbsp; She, seized with
horror, again resisted, when all at once a voice was heard, and
there stood before them a tall and dignified man, who said to the
priest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave untouched that poor girl, who is all purity and
goodness, thou who art all that is vile and foul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the priest, in great terror and white as death,
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Signore Virgilio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thou hast deserved, thou must endure,&rdquo;
replied Virgil, &ldquo;and long and bitter must thy penance be;
but first of all restore to this poor creature all that of which
thou hast robbed her, and make a public avowal of her innocence
and of all thy crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this he did; when Virgil said:</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;Now from this hour thy spirit shall haunt the
street where thou hast lived, and thou shalt never leave it, but
wander up and down, thinking of all the evil thou hast
wrought.&nbsp; And when thou wouldst curse or rage, it shall come
forth from thy mouth in flames, and therewith thou shalt have
some short relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the girl, she was restored to health, and Virgil made
for her a happy life, and she married well, and after a long and
prosperous life passed away, having founded a great family in the
land.</p>
<p>But the goblin friar still haunts the street in Arezzo, for he
has not yet fully and truly repented, and a life as evil as his
leaves its stain long after death.</p>
<h2>IL GIGLIO DI FIRENZE, OR THE STORY OF VIRGIL AND THE
LILIES.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lily is the symbol of beauty and
love.&nbsp; By the Greeks it was called
&Chi;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&alpha;
&Alpha;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&delta;&iota;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, the
joy of Venus, and according to Alciatus, Venus Urania was
represented with a lily in her hand.&rdquo;&mdash;J. B. <span
class="smcap">Friedrich</span>: <i>Die Symbolik der
Natur</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story is of the lily, or the <i>stemma</i>, or crest of
Florence.&nbsp; One day Virgilio went forth to walk when he met
with a Florentine, who saluted him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou truly shouldst be a Florentine, since thou art by
name a <i>vero giglio</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a true lily
(<i>Ver</i>&rsquo;-<i>giglio</i>).</p>
<p>Then the poet replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly I am entitled to the name, since our first
ancestors were as the lilies of the field, who toiled not,
neither did they spin, hence it came that they left me
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thou wilt leave a lordly heritage,&rdquo; replied
the nobleman, smiling; &ldquo;the glory of a great name which
shall honour all thy fellow-citizens, and which will ever remain
in the shield as the flower of Florence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation182"></a><a href="#footnote182"
class="citation">[182]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is a pretty tale, though it turns on a pun, and has
nothing more than that in it.&nbsp; Much has been <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>written to
prove that the lilies in the shields of France and Florence and
on the ends of sceptres are not lilies, but there can be no
reasonable doubt of its Latin symbolical origin.&nbsp; Among the
Romans the lily was the emblem of public hope, of patriotic
expectation, hence we see Roman coins with lilies bearing the
mottoes: <i>Spes Publica</i>, <i>Spes Augusta</i>, <i>Spes Populi
Romani</i>, and Virgil himself, in referring to Marcellus, the
presumed heir to the throne of Augustus, makes Anchises cry:
&ldquo;Bring handfuls of lilies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not occur to me till after translating the foregoing
little tradition, and it is appropriate enough to suggest that it
may have had some connection with the tale.&nbsp; The idea of its
being attached to power, probably in reference to the community
governed, was ancient and widely spread.&nbsp; Not only was the
garment of the Olympian Jupiter adorned with lilies, <a
name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a"
class="citation">[183a]</a> but the old German Thor held in one
hand the lightning and in the other a lily sceptre <a
name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b"
class="citation">[183b]</a> indicating peace and purity, or the
welfare of the people.&nbsp; The lily was also the type of purity
from its whiteness, the origin of which came from Susanna the
Chaste, who during the Babylonian captivity remained the only
virgin.&nbsp; Susan is in Hebrew <i>Shusam</i>, which means a
lily.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was transferred to the Virgin
Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the legend that Saint &AElig;gidius,
when the immaculateness of the Virgin was questioned, wrote in
sand the query as to whether she was a maid before, during, and
after the Conception, whereupon a lily at once grew forth out of
the sand, as is set forth in a poem by the German Smetz&mdash;of
which lily-legends of many kinds there are enough to make a book
as large as this of mine.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>The
cult of the lily in a poetical sense was carried to a great
extent at one time.&nbsp; The Dominican P. Tommaso Caraffa, in
his &ldquo;Poetiche Dicerie,&rdquo; or avowed efforts at fine
writing, devotes a page of affected and certainly florid Italian
to the &ldquo;Giglio,&rdquo; and there are Latin poems or
passages on it by Bisselius, P. Laurent le Brun, P. Alb. Ines,
given by Gandutius (&ldquo;Descriptiones Poetic&aelig;&rdquo;),
Leo Sanctius and A. Chanutius.&nbsp; There is also a passage in
Martial eulogizing the flower in comparing to it the white tunic
given to him by Parthenio:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lilia tu vincis, nec adhuc dilapsa
ligustra,<br />
Et Tiburtino monte quod albet ebur.<br />
Spartanus tibi cedit color, Paphi&aelig;que columna<br />
Cedit Erithr&aelig;is eruta gemma vadis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw once upon a time in Venice a magnificent snow-white
carpet covered with lilies&mdash;a present from the Sultan to the
well-known English diplomat and scholar, Layard&mdash;to which it
seems to me that those lines of the Latin poet would be far more
applicable than they could have been to what was in reality about
the same as an ordinary clean shirt or blouse&mdash;for such was
in fact the Roman tunic.&nbsp; It must, however, be candidly
admitted that he does good service to humanity who in any way
renders romantic, poetic, or popular, clean linen or personal
purity of any kind.</p>

<p>Once the Emperor went hunting, when he heard a marvellously
sweet voice as of a lady singing, and all his dogs, as if called,
ran into the forest.</p>
<p>The Emperor followed and was amazed at seeing a lady,
beautiful beyond any he had ever beheld, holding in one hand a
lily and wearing a broad girdle as of steel and gold, which shone
like diamonds.&nbsp; The dogs fawned round her when the Emperor
addressed her, but as he spoke she sank into the ground, and left
no trace.</p>
<p>The Emperor came the second day also, alone, and beheld her
again, when she disappeared as before.</p>
<p>The third day he told the whole to Virgil, and took the sage
with him.&nbsp; And when the lady appeared Virgil touched her
with his wand, and she stood still as a statue.</p>
<p>Then Virgil said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lord, consider well this Lady of the Lily, and
especially her girdle; for in the time when that lady shall lose
that girdle Florence will gain more in one year than it now
increases in ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this the lady vanished as before, and they returned
home.</p>

<p>The following strange legend, which was taken down by
Maddalena from some authority to me unknown, near Arezzo, is so
imperfectly told in the original, and <a name="page186"></a><span

and botched by an ignorant narrator, that I at first rejected it
altogether; but finding on consideration that it had some curious
relations with other tales, I determined to give it for what it

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Once the Emperor of Rome was in his palace very melancholy,
nor could he rally (<i>ralegrarla</i>), do what he might.&nbsp;
Then he went forth into the groves to hear the birds sing, for
this generally cheered him, but now it was of no avail.</p>
<p>Then he sent a courier to Florence, and bade him call Virgil
with all haste.</p>
<p>Virgil followed the messenger at full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wilt thou of me?&rdquo; asked the sorcerer of the

<p>&ldquo;I wish to be relieved from the melancholy which
oppresses me.&nbsp; I want joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do like me, and thou wilt always have a peaceful
mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I work no evil to any man;<br />
I ever do what good I can.<br />
He who acts thus has ever the power<br />
To turn to peace the darkest hour!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I recall that I ever did anything to
regret,&rdquo; replied the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, come with me, for I think that a little
journey will be the best means of distracting your mind and
relieving you from melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the Emperor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lead where you will; anything for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take a look at all the small districts of
Tuscany,&rdquo; answered Virgil.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Going from the Florentino,<br />
Through Valdarno to Casentino;<br />
Where&rsquo;er we see the olives bloom,<br />
And smell the lily&rsquo;s rich perfume,<br />
And mountains rise and rivulets flow,<br />
Thither, my lord, we two will go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which the Emperor replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er you will, all things to see,<br
/>
High or low&mdash;&rsquo;tis all one to me,<br />
If I can only happy be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they travelled on through many places, but the Emperor was
ever dull and sad; but when in Cortona he said that he felt a
little better, and went forth with Virgil to look about the
town.</p>
<p>[And it was unto this place and to a certain end that Virgil
led his lord.]</p>
<p>Passing along a street, they saw at a window a girl of
extraordinary beauty, who was knitting. . . . <a
name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a"
class="citation">[187a]</a></p>
<p>The girl instead of being angered, laughed, showing two rows
of beautiful teeth, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst become gold, and the skein a twist of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was utterly surprised and confused at this, and knew
not whether to accept or refuse (the gift offered).</p>
<p>The Emperor said to Virgil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see how beautiful she is.&nbsp; I would like to
win her love, and make her mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always the same song,&rdquo; replied Virgil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You never so much as say, &lsquo;I wish she were my
daughter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can never be my daughter,&rdquo; answered the
Emperor; &ldquo;but as she is as poor as she is beautiful, she
may very easily become my love.&nbsp; Honour is of no value to a
poor person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Virgil, &ldquo;when the poor know
its value, it is worth as much to them as gold to you who are
wealthy. <a name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b"
class="citation">[187b]</a>&nbsp; And it is from your neglecting
this that you have so long suffered, you knew not why [but an
evil deed will burn, though you see no light and know not what it
is].&nbsp; For thus didst thou once betray a poor maid, and then
cast her away without a further thought, not even bestowing aught
upon her.&nbsp; And thou hadst a daughter, and her mother now
lies ill and is well nigh to death.&nbsp; And it is this which
afflicted thee [for every deed sends its light or shadow at some
time unto the doer].&nbsp; And now, if thou dost not repair this
wrong, thou wilt never more know peace, and shalt ever sit in the
chair of penitence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;And where is my daughter and her mother?&rdquo;
asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl is the daughter, and if you would see her
mother, follow me,&rdquo; replied Virgil.</p>
<p>When they entered the room where the dying woman lay, the
Emperor recognised in her one whom he had loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she was the most
beautiful to me of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he embraced and kissed her; she was of marvellous beauty;
she asked him if he recognised their daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognise and acknowledge her,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;for I have lived to the
end, and return to life.&nbsp; [I am a fairy (<i>fata</i>) who
came to earth to teach thee that fortune and power are given to
the great not to oppress the weak and poor, but to
benefit.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Saying this she died, and there remained a great bouquet of
flowers.</p>
<p>The Emperor took his daughter to the palace, where she passed
for his niece, and with her the flowers in which he ever beheld
his old fairy love, and thus he lived happy and contented.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To supply a very important omission in this legend, I would
add that the bouquet was certainly of lilies, as occurs in other
legends, and the real meaning of the whole is a very significant
illustration of the history and meaning of the flower.&nbsp; Old
writers and mythic symbolism, as Friedrich and many more have
shown, believed that Nature taught, not vaguely and
metaphorically, but directly, many moral lessons, and that of the
lily was purity and truth.&nbsp; By comparing this with the other
stories relating to this flower which I have given, it will
hardly be denied that my conjectural emendations formed part of
the original, which the narrator had not remembered or
understood.</p>
<p>There is something beautifully poetical in the fancy that
spirits, <i>fata</i>, assume human form, that they by their
influence on great men, princes or kaisars, may <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>change
their lives, and teach them lessons by means of love or
flowers.&nbsp; This makes of the tale an allegory.&nbsp; It was
in this light that Dante saw all the poems of Virgil, as appears
by passages in the &ldquo;Convito,&rdquo; in which curious book
(p. 36, ed. 1490) there is a passage declaring that the world is
round and hath a North and South Pole, in the former of which
there is a city named Maria, and on the other one called Lucia,
and that Rome is 2,600 miles from the one, &ldquo;more or
less,&rdquo; and 7,500 miles from the other.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And thus do men, each in his different
way,<br />
From fancies unto wilder fancies stray.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as the same great poet expresses it in the same curious
book: &ldquo;Man is like unto a weary pilgrim upon a road which
he hath never before travelled, who every time that he sees from
afar a house, deems that it is the lodging which he seeks, and
finding his mistake, believes it is the next, and so he erreth on
from place to place until he finds the tavern which he
seeks.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis the same, be it with boys seeking
apples or birds, or their elders taking fancies to garments, or a
horse, or a woman, or wealth, ever wanting something else or more
and so ever on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lily in Italian tales is the flower of happy, saintly
deaths; it fills the beds of the departing, it sprouts from the
graves of the holy and the good.&nbsp; In one legend it is the
white flower of the departing soul which changes into a white
bird.&nbsp; But in this story it has a doubly significant
meaning, as the crest of Florence and as conveying a significant
meaning to its ruler.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Convito&rdquo; of Dante is not nearly so well known
as the &ldquo;Commedia,&rdquo; but it deserves study.&nbsp; The
only <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>copy which I have ever read is the editio princeps of
1490, which I bought of an itinerant street-vendor for 4 soldi,
or twopence.</p>

<p>There was once a young man of genius, and honest; he was a
true gentleman (<i>vero galantuomo</i>), with a good heart.</p>
<p>At that time there was also in Rome a great magician who was
called the Poet, but his real name was Virgilio.&nbsp; And the
honest youth, whose name was Pollione, was a student with
Virgilio, and also his servant.</p>
<p>Everybody may have heard who Virgilio was, and how he was a
sorcerer above all others.&nbsp; He had a custom of giving to his
friends sayings and proverbs, or sentences <a
name="citation190a"></a><a href="#footnote190a"
class="citation">[190a]</a> wherein there was always wisdom or a
moral.&nbsp; His friends did not know it, but with every one of
these sayings there went a spirit, and if they gave heed to the
saying <a name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b"
class="citation">[190b]</a> the spirit took care that from it
some good resulted to them.</p>
<p>One day when Virgil gave sayings to his friends, he said to
Pollione:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man speaks to you, hear to the end all that he
has to say before answering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>After
a while Pollione left Rome, and went to Florence.&nbsp; While
wandering, he found himself not far from Lucca, in a solitary
forest.&nbsp; And while resting he observed a stone, almost
hidden under the grass, on which stone were letters, and,
clearing it away, he read the word &ldquo;Lift.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
he raised the stone, and found under it a small ancient vase, in
which was a gold ring.&nbsp; Then he took the ring, and went his
way.</p>
<p>And after weary wandering he found a small house, empty, into
which he entered.&nbsp; It was one of the cabins in which
peasants store chestnuts or grain or their implements for
work.&nbsp; Therein was a partition of boards, and the youth lay
down behind it and went to sleep.</p>
<p>After a little time there entered two friars, who never
suspected there was anybody behind the screen, so they began to
talk freely.&nbsp; And Pollione, awaking, listened to them.</p>
<p>One friar said to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now a year since old Father Girolamo died, who on
his deathbed left to us both, to wear by turns, the gold ring
which is hid somewhere in this wood in a vase under a stone on
which is the word &lsquo;Lift.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pity that he died
before he could tell us just where it is.&nbsp; So we have sought
and sought in vain, and so we must seek on, seek ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pollione heard that, in the honesty of his heart, he was
about to show himself and cry out, &ldquo;Here is your
ring!&rdquo; when all at once he recalled the proverb of Virgilio
to always hear all that a man has to say before answering.&nbsp;
So he kept quiet, while the other friar said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest that with that ring one can turn any man
or woman into any kind of an animal.&nbsp; What wouldst thou do
with it if it were thine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;would at once
change our Abbot into an ass, and beat him half to death ten
times a day, because he put me <i>in penitenza</i> and in prison
because I got drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; answered the second friar, &ldquo;would
change the proud, beautiful daughter of the count who lives in
the castle yonder into a female dog, and keep her in that form
till she should consent to be my mistress.&nbsp; Truly, I would
give her a good lesson, and make her repent having scorned
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pollione heard such talk as this he reflected:</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>&ldquo;I think I would do well to keep the ring
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took a piece of paper and wrote on it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;L&rsquo; anello non avrai,<br />
Ma asinello tu sarai,<br />
Tu asinello diventerai<br />
E non l&rsquo;Abate,<br />
Cosi dicono le Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring of gold is not for thee,<br />
For thou thyself an ass shalt be;<br />
Not the Abbot, but thou in truth,<br />
This the Fairies say in sooth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem he placed on the stone which had covered the
ring.&nbsp; And when the two friars found and read it, and
discovered that the ring was gone, they verily believed that the
fairies had overheard them and taken away the ring, and so, full
of sorrow, returned to their convent.</p>
<p>Then Pollione, ever travelling on, one day met in Verona a
clever, bold-looking young man, who was playing marvellous
juggler&rsquo;s tricks in a public place.&nbsp; And, looking
closely at one another, each recognised in his observer the
wizard who knew hidden things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go together,&rdquo; said Pollione.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall do better by mutual aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went into partnership.</p>
<p>One evening they found themselves in a castle, where the
signore treated them very kindly; and this lord had a beautiful
daughter, who looked at Pollione with long glances, nor were his
at her one whit shorter.</p>
<p>But the father seemed to be dying with some great sorrow; and
at last he said to Pollione:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art a gentleman, and a man who is learned in books
and wise.&nbsp; It may be that thou canst give me good advice and
save me.&nbsp; If thou canst, there is nothing of mine which I
will not give thee.&nbsp; And this is the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year ago I was sent on State affairs to
Constantinople, where the Sultan promised me that within a
certain time he would send me a lion as a gift for our Grand
Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after I had returned to Italy I told the Duke of
this, at which he was greatly pleased.&nbsp; But when the time
had come to an end the lion did not arrive.&nbsp; Then several of
the courtiers who were my envious enemies made the Duke believe
that the tale of the lion was all a lie, and a mere boast of
mine.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;Then the Duke said to me that if the lion did
not arrive within six months I should lose my head, and the
allotted time is nearly past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that I can save you,&rdquo; replied
Pollione.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do it, if only to please your
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it, and she shall be thine,&rdquo; answered the
father.</p>
<p>And the daughter smiled.</p>
<p>So the signore wrote to the Grand Duke that on a certain day
the lion would be his, and invited him with all the court to his
castle to see it.</p>
<p>Then there was at the time appointed a grand pavilion, in
which was the Grand Duke, with all the courtiers and music.</p>
<p>The sorcerer Jannes, who was the companion of Pollione, had
formed a deep attachment to the signore, as the latter had to
him.&nbsp; Then the magician asked the lord to point out
carefully to him all those who were his enemies.</p>
<p>And then from a tent there came forth a great lion.&nbsp; It
was the magician, who had been touched by the ring.</p>
<p>The music sounded, and the people cried, &ldquo;<i>Evviva il
lione</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Hurrah for the lion!</p>
<p>But when the lion, running round the course, came to the
courtiers, he roared and became like a raging devil.&nbsp; He
leaped over the barrier, and, attacking the courtiers, tore them
limb from limb, and did terrible things.&nbsp; Nor could the Duke
say anything, for it was his own fault.</p>
<p>Then the lion bounded away and was seen no more.</p>
<p>So the signore was saved, and Pollione wedded his daughter,
and became very wealthy and a great lord.</p>
<p>And it is a true thing that there are wizards&rsquo; sayings
or proverbs which cause good luck&mdash;<i>buona fortuna</i>; and
if such a proverb remains always in the memory the spirit of the
proverb will aid him who knows it.&nbsp; And to secure his aid
one should repeat this spell:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Spirito del proverbio!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ti prego di stampare<br />
Questo proverbio corretamente<br />
Per sempre nella mia mente,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ti prego di aiutarlo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sempre cosi la detta sara<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cagione della felicit&agrave;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit of the proverb,<br />
I pray thee to impress<br />

proverb exactly<br />
And for ever in my mind,<br />
So that it may ever be<br />
A blessing and a joy to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this done, the proverb or poem will become a living
spirit, which will aid you to become learned and wise. <a

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As the <i>Jatakas</i> of Buddha, which perhaps give the origin
of the fable, were all intended to set forth the great doctrine
of the immortality of the soul in transmigrations, so most
stories like the preceding have for an aim or object the teaching
of a spell.&nbsp; That which is here explained is very singular,
yet the idea is one which would naturally occur to a student of
magic.&nbsp; It is that in a deep meaning or moral there is a
<i>charm</i>, and every charm implies a spirit.&nbsp; Hence a
spirit may go with a proverb, which in its form is like a
spell.&nbsp; It is simply a perception of the similarity of a
saying or proverb to a charm.&nbsp; As the Pythagoreans and
Neo-Platonists believed there were spirits in numbers and ideas,
so a believer might even more rationally conceive of a soul in a
wise saying.</p>
<h2>VIRGIL AND MATTEO, OR ANOTHER PROVERB OF VIRGILIO.</h2>

inconsciamente sulle labbre del popolo, oltre contenere una
profonda sapienza . . . manifestano la prontezza, il
brio.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Da Augusto Alfani</span>:
<i>Proverbi e Modi Proverbiali</i> (1882).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following story is translated from the Romognola, or
mountain dialect, also called Bolognesa, which is a rude, strange
patois, believed to be very <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>ancient.&nbsp; It was written by a
native of Rocca Casciano, near Forli.&nbsp; The beginning of it
in the original is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un Eter proverbi di Virgilio</i>.&mdash;Ho iera una
volta un om co des a Verzeglie che un su usen lera un ledre e
vieva rube quaicosa, e &eacute; bon om ed nom Matei, e pregheva
Verzeglie ed ulei de un det, ho proverbi, incontre a e le
der.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was once a man who said to Virgil that one of his
neighbours was a thief, who had stolen something from him, and
the man, whose name was Matteo, begged Virgil to give him a
saying or a proverb against the thief.</p>
<p>Virgil replied: &ldquo;Truly thou hast been robbed; but be of
good cheer, and thou mayst regain thine own again if thou wilt
remember this saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Se un dievele ti disprezza,<br />
Tu guent un dievele e mezza,<br />
E quan e lup la e tu agnel,<br />
L&rsquo; e temp et tol&aacute; su pel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a devil should injure thee,<br />
Doubly a devil thou shouldst be;<br />
And if a wolf thy lamb should win,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time for thee to take his skin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matteo had learned that the thief, whose name was Bandelone,
was in the habit of sitting by a pool or pond, and whenever any
traveller came by he would cry that he had let fall a bag of gold
into the water, and, being very lame and ill, could not dive for
it.&nbsp; So he would promise a great reward to him who would
recover it.</p>
<p>Then the traveller, deluded by the tale, would strip himself
and dive into the pool, which was very deep, with steep
banks.&nbsp; And while he was under water the crafty thief would
seize on his clothes, arms, and money, mount his horse, and ride
away.</p>
<p>Matteo reflected on this.&nbsp; Then he got a small bag and
filled it with nails, so that it seemed to be heavy, as if with
money.&nbsp; So he went to the pool, where Bandelone was waiting
like a spider for flies, and seeing Matteo, whom he did not
recognise, because the latter was disguised, he began to cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, kind sir, have pity on a poor man who has lost his
whole fortune!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he went on to tell how he had
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>dropped
his bag full of gold in the water, and was too weak to dive for
it, with all the rest of the tale.</p>
<p>Then Matteo consented to dive for the purse; but first of all
put his horse, with all his arms and clothes, on the opposite
bank, where they would be in safety.</p>
<p>Bandelone was angry enough at this, and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&nbsp; Do you think I am a
thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, friend,&rdquo; answered Matteo.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if
a thief should come to take my things thou wouldst be too weak to
defend them, and he might do thee harm.&nbsp; It is all for thy
good that I take such care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bandelone wished all this kind care to the devil, but he had
to submit.&nbsp; Then Matteo dived twice or thrice, and then came
out of the water as if overjoyed, crying, as he held his bag of
nails <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a> on high:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ech!&nbsp; Ho alo trov&egrave; e sac d&rsquo;
oro!&nbsp; Com le grand!&rdquo;&mdash;Behold, I have found the
bag of gold!&nbsp; How large it is!</p>
<p>Bandelone was indeed surprised at this; but, believing that
Matteo had by chance really found a treasure, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is mine!&nbsp; Give it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Zentiment</i>!&nbsp; Fair and softly, friend,&rdquo;
replied Matteo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me half, or I will keep it
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bandelone would by no means consent to this.&nbsp; At last
Matteo said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I do not know what is in the bag, I will take
a risk.&nbsp; Give me your horse and sword and cloak for the
bag.&nbsp; That is my last word, and if you utter another I will
ride away with the bag and keep all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bandelone gave him his horse and cloak and a fine
sword.&nbsp; And Matteo, when mounted, pitched him the bag, and
rode away singing merrily:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If a devil should injure thee,<br />
Doubly a devil thou must be;<br />
And if a wolf thy lamb should win,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time for thee to take his skin.&rdquo;</p>

197</span>VIRGILIO AND THE FATHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN.<br />
A <span class="smcap">Legend from Colle di Val d&rsquo;Elsa,
Tuscany</span>.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the earliest form of the legend, Virgil
appears not only as doing no harm, but also as a great
benefactor.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Comparetti</span>:
<i>Virgil in the Middle Ages</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once when Virgil was in Colle di Val d&rsquo;Elsa, he found
that the utmost poverty and wretchedness prevailed among the
people.&nbsp; Everywhere were men and women wailing and weeping
because they could not get food for their children.</p>
<p>Virgil began by giving alms right and left, but was obliged to
cease, finding that all his means would be but a trifle towards
relieving such suffering.&nbsp; Therefore he resolved to go to
the Emperor and beg him to use his authority in the matter.&nbsp;
But while in the first furlong of his journey he met a man
wailing bitterly, and on asking the cause, the one who wept
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caro Signore</i>, I weep in despair not for myself,
but for my twelve children, who, starving, lie on the bare
ground.&nbsp; And this day we are to be turned out of the house
because I owe for the rent.&nbsp; And I have gone hither and
thither to seek work and found none, and now thou knowest
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Virgil, who was kind of heart, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not afraid of the future.&nbsp; Holy Providence
which takes care of the birds of the air will also provide for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; replied the poor man, &ldquo;I
trust it is true what you tell me, but I have waited a long time
now for Holy Providence without seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope yet a little longer,&rdquo; answered Virgil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just now I will go with you to your house and see how I
can aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lord,&rdquo; replied the poor man, whose
doubts in a Holy Providence began to weaken.&nbsp; So they went
together, and truly found twelve children with their mother,
well-nigh dying from cold, hunger, and exposure.</p>
<p>Then Virgil, having relieved them, thought deeply what could
be done to help all this wretchedness, and invoked a certain
spirit in whom he trusted&mdash;<i>un spirito di sua
fiducia</i>&mdash;asking how he could aid the suffering
<i>Colligiani</i>.</p>
<p>And the spirit replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;Sorti da quella casa,<br />
E passa disotto a una torre,<br />
E nel passare<br />
Si senti a chiamare<br />
A nome, alze il capo,<br />
Ma non videte nessuno,<br />
Soltanto senti una voce,<br />
Una voce che le disse<br />
&lsquo;Sali su questa torre!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave this house, in going,<br />
Thou&rsquo;lt pass beneath a tower,<br />
And hear a voice which calls thee,<br />
Yet looking, thou&rsquo;lt see nothing,<br />
Yet still will hear it crying,<br />
&lsquo;Virgil, ascend the tower!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virgil did this, and heard the Voice call him, when he
ascended the tower and there beheld a small red goblin, who was
visible to him alone, because Virgil had invoked him.&nbsp; And
the Spirit said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold this little dog.&nbsp; Return with it to the
house whence thou hast come, and go forth with the poor man, and
take the dog with you.&nbsp; And where the dog stops there
dig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did so.&nbsp; And they went away, and at last the dog
stopped at a place, and the poor man began to dig.&nbsp; And lo!
ere long the earth became red, and he came to iron ore.&nbsp; And
from this discovery resulted the iron factory of Colle, and by it
that of glass; wherever the dog led they found minerals.&nbsp; So
from that time there was no more suffering because there was work
for all.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This legend is a full confirmation of what I have elsewhere
remarked, that these &ldquo;witch-stories&rdquo; have almost
invariably a deeper meaning or moral than is to be found in the
&ldquo;popular tales&rdquo; generally prevalent among peasants
and children.&nbsp; Thus, while we find in this the magician
Virgil, his invocation to a familiar spirit, the apparition of
the Red Goblin of the Tower and the mystical dog of the Kobold,
or goblins of the mines, there is with it a noble reflection that
the best way to relieve suffering is to provide work.&nbsp; In an
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>ordinary
fairy-tale the magician would have simply conjured up a treasure
and have given it to the poor.</p>
<p>Apropos of the word <i>goblin</i>, which is generally supposed
to be from the German <i>Kobold</i>, I would observe that the
Greek &kappa;&omicron;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&iota; or
<i>cobali</i> are defined in a curious old French work as
<i>lutins</i>, &ldquo;household spirits, or domestic
fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VIRGILIO AS A PHYSICIAN, OR VIRGIL AND THE MOUSE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now to signify destruction and death they
paint a <i>mouse</i>.&nbsp; For it gnaweth all things, and works
ruin.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hori Apolli</span>:
<i>Hieroglyphica</i>; <i>Rome</i>, 1606.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There once lived in Florence a young gentleman&mdash;<i>un
gran signore</i>&mdash;who wedded a beautiful young lady to whom
he was passionately attached, as she indeed was for a time to
him.&nbsp; But &ldquo;fickle and fair is nothing rare,&rdquo; and
it came to pass that before long she gave her love again to an
intimate friend of her husband.&nbsp; And the latter did not
indeed perceive the cause, but he was much grieved at the
indifference to him which his wife began to show.</p>
<p>Then the wife began to tell her lover how her husband had
scolded her for her neglect, and how much afraid she was lest
their intrigue would be discovered, and that she was so uneasy
that she was ready to poison her spouse &ldquo;if she could only
get rid of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lover replied that there were many ways to get rid of a
man without really killing him, for that a violent death would
lead to suspicion, inquiry, scandal, and perhaps legal
punishment.&nbsp; And then he hinted that a better method would
be to consult a witch.</p>
<p>The lady lost no time in running to one, to whom she told her
whole story, and what she wanted, and as she began by paying a
large fee, the sorceress promised she should have her wish.</p>
<p>Then the witch prepared with magic skill a flask of water, <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>and a
powder.&nbsp; The water she gave to the wife, and bade her
sprinkle it over her husband&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp; But she
changed herself into a mouse, and having been carried to the
bedroom which the married couple occupied, she gnawed a hole in
the mattress, and crawling in, dragged after her the bag, and so
remained hidden.</p>
<p>When the husband went to bed, there came over him an utter
weakness and sickness, so that he lay in pain as if dead, and
this grew worse day by day.&nbsp; His parents in vain called in
the first physicians, and every remedy was resorted to without
result.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio, who knew much and suspected all the rest of
this affair, was angry that so vile a woman and her gallant
should inflict such torture on an excellent and innocent man, and
resolved to have a hand in the affair.</p>
<p>Therewith he dressed himself as a <i>medico</i>, or doctor,
from some distant land, saying that he had heard of this
extraordinary case of illness, and would like to see the
sufferer.&nbsp; To which the parents replied that he was welcome
to do so, since all the professors of medicine in Florence could
make nothing of it.</p>
<p>The doctor looked steadily for some time at the patient, who
appeared to be in such utter prostration and misery as might have
moved the hardest heart.&nbsp; By him sat his wife, pretending to
weep, but counting to herself with pleasure the time which would
pass before her husband should die&mdash;giving now and then a
suspicious glance at the new-comer.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio said to the wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signora, I beg you to leave the room for a while.&nbsp;
I must be alone with this man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon she, with a great show of tears and passion,
declared she would not leave the room, because her husband might
die at any minute, and she could never forgive herself were she
to be absent, and so on.&nbsp; To which Virgilio angrily replied,
that she might depart in peace, with the assurance that her
husband would be cured.&nbsp; So she went out, cursing him in her
heart, if there was a chance that he could do as he declared.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio took a mirror which he had brought with him, and
placing it before the eyes of the invalid, bade him look at it as
steadily and as long as he could.&nbsp; The young man did so, and
then said, as if in despair:</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;For me there is no remedy, O doctor, for what
you show me is worse than my disorder, as I supposed it to
be.&nbsp; Truly I see death, and not myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; replied Virgilio.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
shall be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cure me,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and you shall have
all that I possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I will cure you first,&rdquo; said Virgilio,
&ldquo;and then settle on easier terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patient looked steadily at the mirror.&nbsp; Virgilio
rapped thrice with a wand, when there suddenly leaped from the
bed a mouse, which uttered three horrible, piercing
screams.&nbsp; The doctor bade the invalid continue to look
steadily at himself in the mirror, and for his life not to cease
doing so.&nbsp; Without turning round, the doctor ordered the
mouse to enter the bed and lick up and bring away with her on her
tongue all the water which the wife had sprinkled on the
clothes.&nbsp; And this done, he bade her bring again out of the
bed all the powder which she had placed there.&nbsp; Which being
effected, he ordered the mouse to make of it a pellet, and devour
it; but here she resisted, for to do that meant death to her and
a cure to the invalid.</p>
<p>But the doctor was inflexible, and she had to obey.&nbsp; Nor
had she begun to eat it before he bade the husband rise, which he
did, feeling perfectly recovered, though much confused at such a
sudden change.</p>
<p>Then Virgilio ordered the mouse to mount the bed, and lo! she
changed to a woman, for she was, of course, the witch who had
done all this devil&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; And the sorceress bade
them call parents and wife and all.&nbsp; And when they came the
witch said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evil my life has been, and evil will be the death which
in a few minutes will come to me; yet am I not so evil as this
woman, who would have killed by the worst suffering the husband
who loved her.&nbsp; For hell hath many who are bad, but the
worst are they who return evil for good.&nbsp; And he who hath
ended this thing by his power is the great Virgilio, who is the
lord of magic in all this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she told, step by step, how the wife had turned her heart
from her husband, almost as soon as she was married, and wished
to kill him, and had paid her to bewitch him.&nbsp; Then Virgilio
opened the window and the witch indeed died, or it was the last
seen of her, for with a horrible howl she vanished in the night,
flying away.</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>The
husband recovered, and would have given Virgilio all his wealth,
but he would accept nothing but the young man&rsquo;s
friendship.&nbsp; And the guilty wife was imprisoned for life in
a castle, far away in the mountains and alone.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Virgil appears as a <i>physician</i> so distinctly in this and
other tales as to induce the question whether he had not, quite
apart from his reputation as poet and magician, some fame as
professor of the healing art.&nbsp; And in fact, as I have shown
in the legend of Virgil and the Spirit of Mirth, he on one
occasion at least is, by P&aelig;onia, identified with
Esculapius.&nbsp; The latter is described as having &ldquo;a
countenance bright with joy and serenity,&rdquo; and being very
benevolent and genial&mdash;wherein he agrees with the
poet.&nbsp; The God of Medicine, it is expressly stated, used
&ldquo;sweet incantations,&rdquo; or poetical spells, which is
also significant.&nbsp; He was also associated with Apollo and
the Muses, as in the temple of Messina.&nbsp; The author of the
great &ldquo;Dizionario Storico Mitologico&rdquo; (1824) plainly
declares that &ldquo;Esculapius is another form of Apollo, in
whom poetry and medicine were combined.&nbsp; In the temple
devoted to him in Sycione, Esculapius is associated with
Diana.&nbsp; In a Roman bas-relief he appears with the Three
Graces; in one of these legends Virgil is associated with four
Venuses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Making every allowance, it must be admitted
that, comparing all that is known of the God of Medicine with
what appears in these legends of the Mantuan bard, there is a
remarkable general likeness between the two.&nbsp; Virgil is
also, here and there, curiously identified with the serpent and
the staff, which were the symbols of Esculapius; and, as I have
before noted, Buddha, who had so much in common with Virgil, was
in his first incarnation a physician.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Virgil is introduced, I may say, almost incidentally in the
following tale, not by any means as <i>coryph&aelig;us</i> or
hero, as is indeed the case in several other stories, which fact,
on due reflection, is of importance, because it indicates
unmistakably that he is so well known in popular tradition as to
be recognisable even in a minor r&ocirc;le.&nbsp; It is as when
one swears by a saint, or Bacchus&mdash;in Florence one hears the
latter invoked forty times where a Christian deity is
apostrophized once&mdash;&rsquo;tis not to form a portion of the
sentence, but to give it force, as Chinese artillerymen, when
they fire a ball at an enemy, sometimes grease the mouth of a
gun, to increase the loudness of the report and thereby frighten
the foe.&nbsp; Which figure of a saint is not that of Saint
Malapropos, because, as the reader may note in another tale,
Virgil is very seriously described as a santo.</p>
<p>Now to the narrative.&nbsp; <i>Sancte Virgile</i>, <i>ora pro
nobis</i>!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In very ancient times there were few families in Cettardo, and
these were all perfectly equal, there being among them neither
rich nor poor.&nbsp; They all worked hard in fields or forests
for a living, and were like a company of friends or brothers.</p>
<p>And of evenings, when they were not too weary, they met many
together in some house, all in love and harmony, to talk about
the crops, and their children, or repeat the <i>rosario</i>, <a
name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a> or discuss their clothing, or cattle,
or whatever interested them.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>These
people were all as one, and had no head or chief. <a
name="citation204a"></a><a href="#footnote204a"
class="citation">[204a]</a>&nbsp; But one evening a very little
girl came out with a thing (<i>sorti con una cosa</i>) which
astonished all who were present, because the child had received
no instruction, and did not know what a school meant.&nbsp; And
what she said was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Babbo</i>&mdash;papa&mdash;I wish to tell thee
something in presence of all who are here assembled, with all due
respect to them, since there are certainly so many here who could
with greater propriety set it forth. <a
name="citation204b"></a><a href="#footnote204b"
class="citation">[204b]</a>&nbsp; Therefore, I trust you will
pardon and bear with me, because I am but an infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all exclaimed in chorus: &ldquo;Speak, and we will listen
to thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the infant, in this fashion, spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know that this night I have spoken with a spirit, the
<i>bel Folettino col beretta rossa</i>&mdash;the beautiful fairy
with the red cap&mdash;and it told me that for this our land we
have no name or coat of arms.&nbsp; But the time has come to have
that which shall represent the country, and therefore we should
choose a chief who will open commerce for us, and found a school
so that our young people shall escape from ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, thou hast spoken well!&rdquo; cried all
present.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Evviva il capo</i>&mdash;hurrah for a
chief!&mdash;and that chief shall be thy father, dear
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; added the good girl, &ldquo;I will, to
show my gratitude, give you the design for the armorial bearings,
and in due time tell you all that is needful to be done.&nbsp;
All of that will I find out, and also a name for the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, and deserve our gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you again,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and I
will pay attention to the subject, since you show such
sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day she went to herd a flock of sheep, as was her
custom; and then, lying down on the ground as wild boars are wont
to do, <a name="citation204c"></a><a href="#footnote204c"
class="citation">[204c]</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Spirito, capo di tutti i spiriti!<br />
Re dei r&eacute; dei Maghi!<br />
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Portami
qui presenti un hoggetto<br />
Che possa servirmi per rappresentare<br />
Un arme.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Una voce le rispose:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chiama e chiama pi&ugrave; forte.<br />
E chiama ancora per tre volte<br />
E chiama il tuo prottetore,<br />
Chi &eacute; con te a tutte le ore<br />
E mai non ti lascera se sempre<br />
Lui invochera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit, who art the chief of all the spirits!<br />
Who art the king of all the sorcerers!<br />
Bring unto me some object which may serve<br />
To represent our land, and be its crest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To which a voice replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Call out aloud, then more forcibly,<br />
And yet again three times, and unto him<br />
Who is thy guardian and ever with thee,<br />
And who will never leave thee&mdash;call to him!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And who art thou who speakest to me?&rdquo; asked the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Spirit of the Red Cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is my protector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magician Virgil,&rdquo; replied the Voice.</p>
<p>Then she invoked Virgil, who appeared in person, and asked
what she would have.</p>
<p>She replied that she had been charged to find a name and
object to represent the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; answered Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
already written the name on a leaf; now take this thing in thy
hand&rdquo;&mdash;here he gave her an onion&mdash;&ldquo;and cast
it into yonder cavern, from which there is an underground
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl obeyed; the onion spun round and rolled away; she
followed it afar, till at last it stopped at a leaf on which was
written &ldquo;Cettardo.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was in this spot
where the onion stopped that the town in after time was built,
and where the girl found the leaf is now the municipal
palace.&nbsp; And so, one by one, great buildings rose.&nbsp;
Thus came the name and arms of Cettardo.</p>
<p>In due time the maid had a lover, and it was said that these
two were the only ones who could go through the subterranean
passage.</p>
<p>And it hath been, and may be still, proved that any <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>person
attempting this passage will after a few steps be suffocated, and
can go no further.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If we compare this legend with other traditions, there can be
little doubt that it is at least of Roman origin.&nbsp; The great
veneration for the onion among the Egyptians&mdash;&ldquo;Happy
people,&rdquo; wrote Juvenal, &ldquo;to have gods growing in
their gardens!&rdquo;&mdash;which passed to the Romans, probably,
in later days through the priests of Serapis and Isis, <a
name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a> and the many mysteries connected with
it, fully account for its being chosen as the symbol of a
city.&nbsp; Its traditions were greatly mingled and confused with
those of the garlic and the leek, but it was above all other
plants a protector against sorcery; that is, against <i>all</i>
evil influence.&nbsp; Where onions could not help, nothing
availed, or as it was expressed, <i>bulbus nihil
profuerit</i>.&nbsp; It would appear from the conjectures of Nork
(<i>Andeutung eines Systemes der Mythologie</i>, p. 125) that the
onion was the sign or crest of the pyramid of Cheops, as it is of
Cettardo.</p>
<p>It is, however, in the mention of a subterranean passage full
of mephitic vapour, which seems to have no connection with the
tale whatever, that the clue to the whole tradition may be
found.&nbsp; The people wanting a name and a site for a city,
receive them from a pythoness or sibyl, the two being identified
in many legends.&nbsp; The grotto of the Sybil near Naples is
approached by a long subterranean road, over which I have myself
passed&mdash;being carried on the back of a strong
peasant-guide.&nbsp; Just in the middle of the wet, winding
cavern, I said: &ldquo;You are a good horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;I am particularly good at eating
macaroni,&rdquo; he replied, and stopped.&nbsp; This was
equivalent to begging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses who talk need the spur,&rdquo; I replied, giving
him a gentle reminder with my heel.&nbsp; He laughed, and trotted
on.&nbsp; However, he got his &ldquo;macaroni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the pythoness, or female oracle, was first intoxicated
with the vapour of carbonic acid gas in a cavern, and that her
utterances were recorded on leaves which blew about loosely and
were then gathered and put together, is well known, and it is
this, apparently, which is meant in this tale by the flying leaf
bearing the name of Cettardo.&nbsp; Plutarch, in his
&ldquo;Treatise on Abandoned Oracles,&rdquo; declares that
&ldquo;the terrestrial effluvium was the conductor of the god
into the body of the Pythia.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the vapours
disappeared, the oracle became dumb, or, as Cicero expresses
it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They ceased because this terrestrial
virtue, which moved the soul of the Pythia by divine inspiration,
disappeared in time, as we have seen rivers dried up or turned
away into other beds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The onion was a symbol of fertility and increase of
population, therefore it was well adapted to serve as a fetish
for a new city.&nbsp; It was also among the Egyptians <i>par
eminence</i> typical of the resurrection, so that no woman was
buried without one. <a name="citation207"></a><a
href="#footnote207" class="citation">[207]</a></p>
<p>It may be observed that in this legend Virgil appears as a
guardian spirit or god, certainly not as a mortal.</p>
<p>It would almost seem as if there were an undercurrent of
genial satire or mockery in the part where <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>the young
Pythia graciously assures the simple peasants that, out of sheer
gratitude and to oblige them, she will consult with&mdash;of all
the gods&mdash;the Robin Good-fellow, or goblin of the red-cap!
who in all tales, Italian as well as English, is ever a tricksy
sprite, more given to teasing and kissing servant-girls, and
playing with children and cats, than aught more dignified.&nbsp;
When we remember that the object of this gracious benevolence is
to make her father chief or king, it verily appears as if the
whole were a &ldquo;put-up job&rdquo; between parent and
child.</p>

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
